<span class="banner">Inknut Antiqua</span>
<p>»Inknut Antiqua« is an Antiqua typeface for literature and long-form text. Approaching the idea of web-publishing as a modern day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_press">Private Press</a>, it is designed to evoke Venetian incunabula and humanist manuscripts, but with the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the kinds of typefaces you find in this artisanal tradition.
<p>It comes with a complement of typographical sorts and OpenType features for the purpose. The proportions of Inknut Antiqua make it well suited for low-resolution screens.
<p>The Inknut (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminalia_chebula">Terminalia chebula</a>) called »harad« in Hindi, is a nut-like fruit that can be used for <a href="http://www.nif.org.in/node/977">ink making</a> and is purported to cure blindness.

<br>
-अनुवादक नरेन्द्र चौधरी</p>

<p>यूसूफ अल-फाख़री की आयु तब तीस वर्ष की थी, जब उन्होंने संसार को त्याग दिया और उत्तरी लेबनान में वह कदेसा की घाटी के समीप एक एकांत आश्रम में रहने लगे। आपपास के देहातों में यूसुफ के बारे में तरह-तरह की किवदन्तियां सुनने में आती थीं। कइयों का कहना था कि वे एक धनी-मानी परिवार के थे और किसी स्त्री से प्रेम करने लगे थे, जिसने उनके साथ विश्वासघात किया। अत: (जीवन से) निराश हो उन्होंने एकान्तवास ग्रहण कर लिया। कुछ लोगों का कहना था कि वे एक कवि थे और कोलाहलपूर्ण नगर को त्यागकर वे इस आश्रम में इसलिए रहने लगे कि यहां (एकान्त में) अपने विचारों को संकलित कर सकें और अपनी ईश्वरीय प्रेरणाओं को छन्दोबद्ध कर सकें। परन्तु कइयों का यह विश्वास था कि वे एक रहस्यमय व्यक्ति थे और उन्हें अध्यात्म में ही संतोष मिलता था, यद्यपि अधिकांश लोगों क यह मत था कि वे पागल थे।</p>
<p>जहां तक मेरा सम्बन्ध है, इस मनुष्य के बारे में मैं किसी निश्चय पर न पहुंच पाया, क्योंकि मैं जानता था कि उसके हृदय में कोई गहरा रहस्य छिपा है, जिसक ज्ञान कल्पना-मात्र से प्राप्त नहीं किया जा सकता। एक अरसे से मैं इस अनोखे मनुष्य से भेटं करने की सोच रहा था। मैंने अनेक प्रकार से इनसे मित्रता स्थापित करने का प्रयास किया; इसलिए कि मैं इनकी वास्तविकता को जान सकूं और यह पूछकर कि इनके जीवन का क्या ध्येय है, इनकी कहानी को जान लूं। किन्तु मेरे सभी प्रयास विफल रहे। जब मैं प्रथम बार उनसे मिलने गया तो वे लेबनान के पवित्र देवदारों के जंगल में घूस रहे थे। मैंने उन्हें चुने हुए शब्दों की सुन्दरतम भाषा में उनका अभिवादन किया, किन्तु उन्होंने उत्तर में जरा-सा सिर झुकाया और लम्बे डग भरते हुए आगे निकल गये।</p>
<p>दूसरी बार मैंने उन्हें आश्रम के एक छोटे-से अंगूरों के बगीचे के बीच में खड़े देखा। मैं फिर उनके निकट गया। और इस प्रकार कहते हुए उनका अभिनन्दन किया, "देहात के लोग कहा करते हैं कि इस आश्रम का निर्माण चौदहवीं में सीरिया-निवासियों के एक सम्प्रदाय ने किया था। क्या आप इसके इतिहास के बारे में कुछ जानते है?"</p>
<p>उन्होंने उदासीन भाव में उत्तर दिया, "मैं नहीं जानता कि उस आश्रम को किसने बनवाया और सन ही मुझे यह जानने की परवा है।" उन्होंने मेरी ओर से पीठ फेर जली और बोले, "तुम अपने बाप-दादों से क्यों नहीं पूछते, जो मुझसे अधिक बूढ़े हैं और जो इन घाटियों के इतिहास से मुझसे कहीं अधिक परिचित हैं?"</p>
<p>अपने प्रयास को बिल्कुल ही व्यर्थ समझकर मैं लौट आया।</p>
<p>इस प्रकार दो वर्ष व्यतीत हो गये। उस निराले मनुष्य की झक्की जिन्दगी ने मेरे मस्तिष्क में घर कर लिया और वह बार-बार मेरे सपनों में आ-आकर मुझे तंग करने लगा।</p>
<p>शरद् ऋतु में एक दिन, जब मैं यूसुफ-अल फ़ाखरीके आश्रम के पास की पहाड़ियों तथा घाटियों में घूमता फिर रहा था, अचानक एक प्रचण्ड आंधी और मूसलाधार वर्षा ने मुझे घेर लिया और तूफान मुझे एक ऐसी नाव की भांति इधर-से-उधर भटकाने लगा, जिसकी पतवार टूट गई हो और जिसका मस्तूल सागर के तूफानी झकोरों से छिन्न-भिन्न हो गया हो। बड़ी कठिनाई से मैंने अपने पैरों को यूसुफ साहब के आश्रम की ओर बढ़ाया और मन-ही-मन सोचने लगा, "बड़े दिनों की प्रतीक्षा के बाद यह एक अवसर हाथ लगा है। मेरे वहां घुसने के लिए तूफान एक बहाना बन जायगा और अपने भीगे हुए वस्त्रों के कारण मैं वहां काफी समय तक टिक सकूंगा।"</p>
<p>जब मैं आश्रम में पहुंचा तो मेरी स्थिति अत्यन्त ही दयनीय हो गई थी। मैंने आश्रम के द्वार को खटखटाया तो जिनकी खोज में मैं था, उन्होंने ही द्वार खोला। अपने एक हाथ में वह ऐसे मरणसन्न पक्षी को लिये हुए थे, जिसके सिर में चोट आई थी और पंख कट गये थे। मैंने यह कहकर उनकी अभ्यर्थना की, "कृपया मेरे इस बिना आज्ञा के प्रवेश और कष्ट के लिए क्षमा करें। अपने घर से बहुत दूर तूफान में मैं बुरी तरह फंस गया था।"</p>
<p>त्यौरी चढ़ाकर उन्होंने कहा, " इस निर्जन वन में अनेक गुफांए हैं, जहां तुम शरण ले सकते थे।" किन्तु जो भी हो, उन्होंने द्वार बन्द नहीं किया। मेरे हृदय की धड़कन पहले से ही बढ़ने लगी; क्योंकि शीघ्र ही मेरी सबसे बड़ी तमन्ना पूर्ण होने जा रही थी। उन्होंने पक्षी के सिर को अत्यन्त ही सावधानी से सहलाना शुरु किया और इस प्रकार अपने एक ऐसे गुण को प्रकट करने लगे, जो मुझे अति प्रिय था। मुझे इस मनुष्य के दो प्रकार के परस्पर विरोधी गुण-दया और निष्ठुरता-को एक साथ देखकर आश्चर्य हो रहा था। हमें ज्ञात हुआ कि हम गहरी निस्तब्धता के बीच खड़े है। उन्हें मेरी उपस्थिति पर क्रोध आ रहा था और मैं वहां ठहरे रहना चाहता था।</p>
<p>ऐसा प्रतीत होता है कि उन्होंने मेरे विचारों को भांप लिया, क्योंकि उन्होंने ऊपर (आकाश) की ओर देखा और कहा, "तूफान साफ है और खट्टा (बुरे मनुष्य का) मांस खाना नहीं चाहता। तुम इससे बचना क्यों चाहते हो?"</p>
<p>कुछ व्यंग्य से मैंने कहा, "हो सकता है, तूफान खट्टी और नमकीन वस्तुएं न खाना चाहता हो, किन्तु प्रत्येक पदार्थ को वह ठण्ड़ा तथा शक्तिहीन बना देने पर तुला है और निस्संदेह यह वह मुझे फिर से पकड़ लेगा तो अपने में समाये बिना न छोड़ेगा।"</p>
<p>उनके चेहरे का भाव यह कहते-कहते अत्यन्त कठोर हो गया, "यदि तूफान ने तुम्हें निगल लिया होता तो तुम्हारा बड़ा सम्मान किया होता, जिसके तुम योग्य भी नहीं हो।"</p>
<p>मैंने स्वीकारते हुए कहा, "हां श्रीमान! मैं इसीलिए तूफान से छिप गया कि कहीं ऐसा सम्मान न पा जाऊं, जिसके कि मैं योग्य ही नहीं हूं।"</p>
<p>इस चेष्टा में कि वे अपने चेहरे पर की मुस्कान मुझसे छिपा सकें, उन्होंने अपना मुंह फेर लिया। तब वे अंगीठी के पास रखी हुई एक लकड़ी की बेंच की ओर बढ़े और मुझसे कहा कि मैं विश्राम करुं और अपने वस्त्रों को सूखा लूं। अपने उल्लास को मैं बड़ी कठिनाई से छिपा सका।</p>
<p>मैंने उन्हें धन्यावाद दिया और स्थान ग्रहण किया। वे भी मेरे सामने ही एक बेंच पर, जो पत्थर को काटकर बनाई गई थी, बैठ गये। वे अपनी उंगलियों को एक मिट्टी के बरतन में, जिसमें एक प्रकार का तेल रखा हुआ था, बार-बार डुबोने लगे और उस पक्षी के सिर तथा पंखों पर मलने लगे।</p>
<p>बिना ऊपर को देखे ही बोले, "शक्तिशाली वायु ने इस पक्षी को जीवन-मृत्यु के बीच पत्थरों पर दे मारा था।",</p>
<p>तुलना-सी करते हुए मैंने उत्तर दिया, "और भयानक तुफान ने इससे पहले कि मेरा सिर चकनाचूर हो जाय और मेरे पैर टूट जायं मुझे भटकाकर आपके द्वार पर भेज दिया।" गम्भीरतापूर्वक उन्होंने मेरी ओर देखा और बोले, "मेरी तो यही चाह है कि मनुष्य पक्षियों का स्वभाव अपनाये और तूफान मनुष्य के पैर तोड़ डाले; मनुष्य का झुकाव भय और कायरता की ओर है और जैसे ही वह अनुभव करता है कि तूफान जाग गया है, यह रेगते-रेंगते गुफाओं और खाइयों में घुस जाता है। अपने को छिपा लेता हैं।"</p>
<p>मेरा उद्देश्य था कि उनके स्वत: स्वीकृत एकान्तवास की कहानी जान लूं। इसीलिए मैंने उन्हें यह कहकर उत्तेजित किया, "हां! पक्षी के पास ऐसा सम्मान और साहस है, जो मनुष्य के पास नहीं। मनुष्य विधान तथा सामाजिक आचारों के साये में वास करता है, जो उसने अपने लिए स्वयं बनाये हैं: किन्तु पक्षी उसी स्वतन्त्र –शाश्वत विधान के अधीन रहते हैं, जिसके कारण पृथ्वी सूर्य के चारों ओर रास्ते पर निरन्तर घूमती रहती है।"</p>
<p>उनके नेत्र और चेहरा चमकने लगे, मानों मुझसे उन्होंने एक समझदार शिष्य को पा लिया हो। वे बोले, "अति सुन्दर! यदि तुम्हे स्वयं अपने शब्दों पर विश्वास है तो तुम्हें सभ्यता और उसके दूषित विधान तथा अति प्राचीन परम्पराओं को तुरन्त ही त्याग देना चाहिए और पक्षियों की तरह ऐसे शून्य स्थान में रहना चाहिए, जहां आकाश और पृथ्वी के महान विधान के अतिरिक्त कुछ भी न हो।</p>
<p>"विश्वास रखना एक सुन्दर बात है; किन्तु उस विश्वास को प्रयोग में लाना साहस का काम है। अनेक मनुष्य ऐसे हैं, जो सागर की गर्जन के समान चीखते रहते हैं, किन्तु उनका जीवन खोखला और प्रवाहहीन होता है जैसे कि सड़ती हुई दल-दल, और अनेक ऐसे हैं, जो अपने सिरों को पर्वत की चोटी से भी ऊपर उठाये चलते हैं, किन्तु उनकी आत्माएं कन्दराओं के अन्धकार में सोती पड़ी रहती हैं।"</p>
<p>वे कांपते हुए अपनी जगह से उठे और पक्षी को खिड़की के ऊपर एक तह किये हुए कपड़े पर रख आये। तब उन्होंने कुछ सूखी लकड़ियां अंगीठी में डाल दीं। और बोले, "अपने जूतों को उतार दो और अपने पैरों को सेंक लो, क्योंकि भीगे रहना आदमी के स्वास्थय के लिए हानिकारक है। तुम अपने वस्त्रों को ठीक से सूखा लो और आराम से बैठो।"</p>
<p>यूसुफ साहब के इस निरन्तर आतिथ्य ने मेरी आशाओं को उभार दिया। मैं आग के और समीप खिसक गया और मेरे भीगे कुरते से पानी भाप बनकर उड़ने लगा। जब वह भूरे आकाश को निहारते हुए ड्योढ़ी पर खड़े रहे मेरा मस्तिष्क उनके आन्तरिक रहस्यों को खोजता दौड़ रहा था। मैंने एक अनजान की तरह उनसे पूछा, "क्या आप बहुत दिनों से यहां रह रहे है?"</p>
<p>मेरी ओर देखे बिना ही उन्होंने शान्त स्वर में कहा, "मैं इस स्थान पर तब आया था, जब यह पृथ्वी निराकार तथा शून्य थी, जब इसके रहस्यों पर अन्धकार छाया हुआ था, और ईश्वर की आत्मा पानी की संतह पर तैरती थी।"</p>
<p>यह सूनकर मैं अवाक् रह गया। क्षुब्ध और अस्त-व्यस्त ज्ञान को समेटने का संघर्ष करते हुए मन-ही-मन मैं बोला, "कितने अजीब व्यक्ति हैं ये और कितना कठिन है इनके वास्तविकता को पाना! किन्तु मुझे सावधानी के साथ, धीरे-धीरे और संतोष रखकर तबतक चोट करनी होगी, जबतक इनकी मूकता बातचीत में न बदल जाय और इनके विचित्रता समझ में न आ जाय!"</p>
<p>रात्रि अपनी अन्धकार की चादर उन घाटियों पर फैला रही थी। मतवाला तूफान चिंघाड़ रहा था और वर्षा बढ़ती ही जा रही थीं। मैं सोचने लगा कि बाइबिल वाली बाढ़ चैतन्य को नष्ट करने और ईश्चर की धरती पर से मनुष्य की गंदगी को धोने के लिए फिर से आ रही है॥</p>
<p>ऐसा प्रतीत होने लगा कि तत्वों की क्रान्ति ने यूसुफ साहब के हृदय में एक ऐसी शान्ति उत्पन्न की है, जो प्राय: स्वभाव पर अपना असर छोड़ जाती है और एकान्तता को प्रसन्नता से प्रतिबिम्बित कर जाती है। उन्होंने दो मोमबत्तियां सुलगायीं और तब मेरे सम्मुख शराब की एक सुराही और एक बड़ी तश्तरी में रोटी मक्खन, जैतून के फल, मधु और कुछ सूखे मेवे लाकर रक्खे। तब वह मेरे पास बैठ गये और खाने की थोड़ी मात्रा के लिए–उसकी सादगी के लिए नहीं- क्षमा मांग कर, उन्होंने मुझसे भोजन करने को कहा।</p>
<p>हम उस समझी–बूझी निस्तब्धता में हवा के विलाप तथा वर्षा के चीत्कार को सुनते हुए साथ-साथ भोजन करने लगे। साथ ही मैं उनके चेहने को घूरता रहा और उनके हृदय के रहस्यों को कुरेद-कुरेदकर निकालने का प्रयास करता रहा। उनके असाधारण अस्तित्व के सम्भव कारण को भी सोचता रहा। भोजन समाप्त करके उन्होंने अंगीठी पर से एक पीतल की केतली उठाई और उसमें से शुद्ध सुगन्धित कॉफी दो प्यालों में उड़ेल दी। तब उन्होंने एक छोटे-से लड़की के बक्स को खोला और 'भाई' शब्द से सम्बोधित कर, उसमे से एक सिगरेट भेंट की। कॉफी पीते हुए मैंने सिगरेट ले ली, किन्तु जो कुछ भी मेरी आंखे देख रही थी, उस पर मुझे विश्वास नहीं हो रहा था।</p>
<p>उन्होंने मेरी ओर मुस्कराते हुए देखा और अपनी सिगरेट का एक लम्बा कश खींचकर तथा काफी की एक चुस्की लेकर उन्होंने कहा, "अवश्य ही तुम-मदिरा, कॉफी और सिगरेट यहां पाकर सोच में पड़ गये हो और मेरे खान-पान तथा ऐश आराम पर उन्हीं लोगों में से एक हो, जो इन बातों में विश्चास करते हैं। कि लोगों से दूर रहने पर मनुष्य जीवन से भी दूर हो जाता है। और ऐसे मनुष्य को उस जीवन के सभी सुखों से वंचित रहना चाहिए।"</p>
<p>, मैंने तुरन्त स्वीकार कर लिया, "हां! ज्ञानियों का यही कहना है कि जो केवल ईश्वर की प्रार्थना करने के लिए संसार को त्याग देता है, वह जीवन के समस्त सुख और आनन्द को अपने पीछे छोड़ आता है, केवल ईश्वर द्वारा निर्मित वस्तुओं पर सन्तोष करता है और पानी और पौधों पर ही जीवित रहता है।"</p>
<p>जरा रुककर गहन विचारों में निमग्न वे बोले, "मैं ईश्वर की भक्ति तो उसके जीवों के बीच रहकर भी कर सकता था, क्योंकि उसे तो मैं हमेशा से अपने माता-पिता के घर पर भी देखता आया हूं। मैंने मनुष्यों का त्याग केवल इसलिए किया कि उनका और मेरा स्वभाव मिलता न था और उनकी कल्पना मेरी कल्पनाओं से मेल नहीं खाती थीं। मैंने आदमी को इसीलिए छोड़ा क्योंकि मैंने देखा कि मेरी आत्मा के पहियों से जोर से टकरा रहे हैं और दूसरी दिशा में घूमते हुए दूसरी आत्माओ के पहियों से जोर से टकरा रहे है। मैंने मानव –सभ्यता को छोड़ि दिया, क्योकि मैंने देखा कि वह एक ऐसा पेड़ हैं, जो अत्यन्त पुराना और भ्रष्ट हो चुका है, किन्तु है शक्तिशाली तथा भयानक। उसकी जड़ें पृथ्वी के अंधकार में बन्द हैं और उसकी शाखांए बादलों में खो गई हैं। किन्तु उसके फूल लोभ, अधर्म और पाप से बने हैं और फल दु:ख संतोष और भय से। धार्मिक मनुष्यों ने यह बीड़ा उठाया हैं। उसके स्वाभाव को बदल देगें, किन्तु वे सफल नहीं हो पाये हैं। वे निराश तथा दुखी होकर मृत्यु को प्राप्त हुए।"</p>
<p>यूसुफ साहब अंगीठी की ओर थोड़ा-सा झुके, मानों अपने शब्दों की प्रतिक्रिया जानने की प्रतीक्षा में हों। मैंने सोचा कि श्रोता ही बने रहना सर्वोत्तम है। वे कहने लगे, "नहीं, मैंने एकान्तवास इसलिए नहीं अपनाया कि मैं एक संन्यासी की भांति जीवन व्यतीत करूं, क्योंकि प्रार्थना, जो हृदय का गीत है, चाहे सहस्त्रों की चीख-पुकार की अवाज से भी घिरी हो, ईश्वर के कानों तक अवश्य पहुंच जायेगी।</p>
<p>"एक बैरागी का जीवन बिताना तो शरीर और आत्मा को कष्ट देना है तथा इच्छाओं का गला घोंटना है। यह एक ऐसा अस्तित्व है, जिसके मैं नितान्त विरुद्ध हूं; क्योंकि ईश्वर ने आत्माओं के मंदिर के रूप में ही शरीर का निमार्ण किया है। और हमारा यह कर्तव्य है कि उसे विश्वास को, जो परमात्मा ने हमें प्रदान किया हैं, योग्यतपूर्वक बनाये रखें।</p>
<p>"नहीं, मेरे भाई, मैंने परमार्थ के लिए एकान्तवास नहीं अपनाया, अपनाया तो केवल इसलिए कि आदमी और उसके विधान से, उसके विचारों तथा उसकी शिकायतों से उसके दु:ख और विलापों से दूर रहूं।</p>
<p>"मैंने एकान्तवास इसलिए अपनाया कि उन मनुष्यों के चेहरे न देख सकूं, जो अपना विक्रय करते हैं और उसी मूल्य से ऐसी वस्तुंए खरीदते है, जो आध्यात्मिक तथा भौतिक दोनों ही रुप उनसे भी घटिया हैं।</p>
<p>"मैंने एकान्तवास इसलिए ग्रहण किया कि कहीं उन स्त्रियों से मेरी भेटं न हो जाए, जो अपने ओठों पर अनेकविध मुस्कान फैलाये गर्व से घूमती रहती हैं- जबकि उनके सहस्त्रों हृदयों की गहराइयों में बस एक ही उद्देश्य विद्यमान है।</p>

<span class="devanagari"><p><em>सोळा सोमवार व्रतकथा</em><br>
आटपाट नगर होतं. त्या नगरांत एक महादेवाचं देऊळ होत. एके दिवशी काय झालं? शिवपार्वती फिरतां फिरतां त्या देवळात आली. सारीपाट खेळू लागली, "डाव कोणी जिंकला?" म्हणून पार्वतीनं गुरवाला विचारलं. त्यानं शंकराचं नाव सांगितलं. पार्वतीला राग आला. गुरवाला "तूं कोडी होशील" म्हणून शाप दिला. तशा त्याला असह्य वेदना होऊं लागल्या. पुढं एके दिवशीं काय झालं ? देऊळीं स्वर्गींच्या अप्सरा आल्या. त्यांनी गुरव कोडी पाहिला. त्याला कारण पुशिलं. गुरवानं गिरिजेचा शाप सांगितला. त्या म्हणाल्या, "भिऊं नको. घाबरू नको. तूं सोळा सोमवारांचं व्रत कर, म्हणजे तुझं कोड जाईल." गुरव म्हणाला, "तें व्रत कसं करावं?" अप्सरांनी सांगितलं, "सारा दिवस उपवास करावा. संध्याकाळी आंघोळ करावी. शंकराची पूजा करावी. नंतर अर्धा शेर कणीक घेऊन त्यांत तूप गूळ घालावा व तें खावं. मीठ त्या दिवशी खाऊं नये. त्याप्रमाणं सोळा सोमवार करावे. सतरावे सोमवारी पांच शेर कणीक घ्यावी, त्यांत तूप गूळ घालून चूर्मा करावा. तो देवळीं न्यावा. भक्तीनं शंकराची षोडशोपचारें पूजा करावी. नंतर चूर्म्याचा नैवेद्य दाखवावा. पुढं त्याचे तीन भाग करावे. एक भाग देवाला द्यावा, दुसरा भाग देउळीं ब्राह्मणांना वाटावा किंवा गाईला चारावा, तिसरा भाग आपण घरी घेऊन जाऊन सहकुटुंबी भोजन करावं." असं सांगून त्या नाहीशा झाल्या. पुढं गुरवानं ते व्रत केलं, गुरव चांगला झाला.</p>
<p>पुढं काही दिवसांनी शंकरपार्वती पुन्हां त्या देउळीं आलीं. पार्वतीनं गुरवाला कुष्ठरहित पाहिलं. तिनं गुरवाला विचारलं, "तुझं कोड कशानं गेलं?" गुरवानं सांगितलं, "मी सोळा सोमवारांचं व्रत केलं, त्यानं माझं कोड गेलं." पार्वतीला आश्चर्य वाटलं. तिनं आपला रागावून गेलेला मुलगा कार्तिकस्वामी परत यावा म्हणून हें व्रत केलं. समाप्तीनंतर कार्तिक-स्वामी लागलीच येऊन भेटला. दोघांना आनंद झाला. त्यानं आईला विचारलं, "आई आई, मी तर तुझ्यावर रागावून गेलो होतो, आणि मला पुन्हां तुझ्या भेटीची इच्छा झाली, याचं कारण काय?" पार्वतीनं त्याला सोळा सोमवारच्या व्रताचा महिमा सांगितला. पुढें कार्तिकस्वामीनं तें व्रत केलं.</p>
<p>त्याचा एक ब्राह्मण मित्र फार दिवस देशांतराला गेला होता त्याची व ह्याची सहज रस्त्यांत भेट झाली. पुढें कार्तिकस्वामीनं हें व्रत त्या ब्राह्मणाला सांगितलं. त्यानं लग्नाचा हेतु मनांत धरला. मनोभावे सोळा सोमवारांचं व्रत केलं. समाप्तीनंतर तो प्रवासाला निघाला. फिरतां फिरतां एका नगरांत आला. तिथं काय चमत्कार झाला? तिथल्या राजाच्या मुलीचं लग्न होतं. लग्नाला अनेक देशांचे राजपुत्र आले होते. मंडप चांगले सुशोभित केले आहेत. लग्नाची वेळ झाली आहे. पुढं राजानं हत्तिणीच्या सोंडेत माळ दिली. माळ ज्याच्या गळ्यांत हत्तिण घालील, त्याला आपली मुलगी द्यायची असा राजाचा पण होता. तिथं आपला हा ब्राह्मण ती मौज पहायला गेला होता. पुढं कर्मधर्मसंयोगानं ती माळ हत्तिणीनं ह्याच ब्राह्मणाच्या गळ्यांत घातली, तशी राजानं आपली मुलगी त्याला दिली. दोघांचं लग्न लावलं, व नवरानवरींची बोळवण केली.</p>
<p>पुढं काय झालं? राजाची मुलगी मोठी झाली. तशीं दोघं नवराबायको एका दिवशी खोलींत बसली आहेत, तसं बायकोनं नवर्‍याला विचारलं, "कोणत्या पुण्यानं मी आपणांस प्राप्त झालें?" त्यानं तिला सोळा सोमवारांच्या व्रताचा महिमा सांगितला. त्या व्रताची प्रचीति पाहण्याकरितां पुत्रप्राप्तीचा हेतु मनात धरला व तें व्रत ती करूं लागली. तसा तिला सुंदर मुलगा झाला. तो मोठा झाल्यावर त्यानं आईला विचारलं की, "मी कोणत्या पुण्यानं तुला प्राप्त झालों?" तिनं त्याला व्रताचा महिमा सांगितला. त्यानं राज्यप्राप्तीची इच्छा मनांत धरली. तो व्रत करू लागला व देशपर्यटनाला निघाला. इकडे काय चमत्कार झाला? फिरतां फिरतां तो एका नगरांत गेला. त्या राजाला मुलगा नव्हता. एक मुलगी मात्र होती. तेव्हां कोणीतरी एकादा सुंदर व गुणवान असा नवरा मुलगा पाहून त्याला आपली मुलगी द्यावी, व राज्यही त्यालाच द्यावं, असा त्यानं विचार केला. अनायासं त्या पुत्राची गांठ पडली. राजानं त्याला पाहिलं तो राजचिन्हं त्याच्या दृष्टीस पडलीं. राजानं त्याला आपल्या घरी आणलं, कन्यादान केलं व त्याला आपल्या राज्यावर बसवलं.</p>
<p>इतकं होतं आहे तों त्या ब्राह्मणाचा सतरावा सोमवार आला. ब्राह्मणपुत्र देऊळी गेला. घरीं बायकोला निरोप पाठविला की, पांच शेर कणकीचा चुर्मा पाठवून दे. राणीनं आपला थोरपणा मनांत आणला. चुर्म्याला लोक हसतील, म्हणून एका तबकांत पांचशें रुपये भरून ते पाठवून दिले. चुर्मा वेळेवर आला नाहीं, व्रतभंग झाला म्हणून देवाला राग आला. त्याने राजाला दृष्टांतदिला. तो काय दिला? राणीला घरात ठेवशील तर राज्याला मुकशील. दारिद्यानं पिडशील. असा शाप दिला. पुढं दुसरे दिवशीं ही गोष्ट राजानं प्रधानाला सांगितली. तो म्हणाला, महाराज, "राज्य हें तिच्या बापाचं. आपण असं करू लागलो तर लोक दोष देतील, याकरितां असं करणं अयोग्य आहे. राजा म्हणाला, ईश्वराचा दृष्टान्त, अमान्य करणं हेंही अयोग्य आहे. " मग उभयतांनी विचार केला. तिला नगरांतून हाकलून लावलं.</p>
<p>पुढं ती दीन झाली, रस्त्यानं जाऊं लागली. जातां जातां एका नगरात गेली. तिथं एका म्हातारीच्या घरी उतरली. तिनं तिला ठेवून घेतलं, खाऊंपिऊं घातलं. पुढं काय झालं ? एके दिवशीं म्हातारीन तिला चिवटं विकायला पाठवलं. दैवाची गति विचित्र आहे! बाजारांत ती चालली. मोठा वारा आला, सर्व चिवटं उडून गेलीं. तिनं घरीं येऊन म्हातारीला सांगितलं. तिनं तिला घरांतून हांकलून लावलं. तिथून निघाली तों एका तेल्याच्या घरी गेली. तिथं तेलाच्या घागरी भरल्या होत्या. त्यांजवर तिची नजर गेली. तसं त्यांतलं सगळं तेल नाहीसं झालं. म्हणून तेल्यानं तिला घालवून दिलं. पुढं तिथून निघाली. वाटेनं जाऊ लागली. जातां जातां एक नदी लागली. त्या नदीला पाणी पुष्कळ होतं. पण तिची दृष्टि त्याजवर गेल्याबरोबर सर्व पाणी आटून गेलं. पुढं जातां जातां एक सुंदर तळं लागलं. त्याजवर तिची दृष्टि गेली, तसे पाण्यांत किडे पडले. पाणी नासून गेलं. रोजच्यासारखे तळ्यावर गुराखी आले. नासकं पाणी पाहून मागं परतले. गुरंढोरं तान्हेली राहिली. पुढं काय झालं? एक गोसावी आला. त्यानं तिला पाहिलं. कोण कुठची म्हणून सगळी हकीकत विचारली. तिनं सगळी हकीकत सांगितली. गोसाव्यानं तिला धर्मकन्या मानलं व आपले घरी घेऊन आला. तिथं राहून ती कामधंदा करू लागली. तशी जिकडे तिकडे तिची दृष्टि जाऊं लागली. ज्यांत तिची दृष्टि जाई त्यांत किडे पडावे, कांही जिनसा आपोआप नाहीशा व्हाव्या, असा चमत्कार होऊ लागला. मग गोसाव्यानं विचार केला, अंतदृष्टि लावली. तिच्या पदरी व्रत मोडल्याचं पाप आहे असं त्यानं जाणलं. तें नाहीसं केल्याशिवाय तिची दृष्टि चांगली होणार नाहीं असं ठरवलं. मग त्यानं शंकराची प्रार्थना केली. देव प्रसन्न झाले. गोसाव्यानं राणीबद्दल प्रार्थना केली. शंकरानं तिला सोळा सोमवारांचं व्रत करायला सांगितलं व आपण अंतर्धान पावले. पुढं गोसाव्यानं तिच्याकडून सोळा सोमवारांचं व्रत करविलं, तसा परमेश्वराचा कोप नाहींसा झाला.</p>
<p>तिच्या नवर्‍याला तिच्या भेटीची इच्छा उद्भवली. दूत चोहिंकडे शोधाला पाठवले. शोधतां शोधतां तिथ आले. गोसाव्याच्या मठींत राणीला पाहिलं. तसंच जाऊन त्यांनीं सांगितलं. त्याला मोठा आनंद झाला. राजा प्रधानसुद्धा गोसाव्याकडे आला. गोसाव्याला साष्टांग नमस्कार केला. वस्त्रप्रावर्ण देऊन संतोषित केलं. गोसावी म्हणाला, राजा राजा, ही माझी धर्मकन्या. मी इतके दिवस तिला माहेरी ठेवून घेतलं होतं, ती तुझी स्त्री आपले घरी घेऊन जा, व चांगल्या रीतीनं पाणिग्रहण करून सुखानं नांद." राजानं होय म्हटलं. गोसाव्याला जोड्यानं नमस्कार केला व राणीला घेऊन आपल्या नगरीं आला. पुढं मोठा उत्सव केला. दानदक्षिणा देऊन ब्राह्मण संतुष्ट केले. राजाराणींची भेट झाली. आनंदानं रामराज्य करूं लागलीं.</p>
<p>तसे तुम्ही शंकराला प्रसन्न करून रामराज्य करा. ही साठां उत्तरांची कहाणी पांचां उत्तरीं देवाब्राह्मणांचे द्वारीं, गाईंचे गोठीं, पिंपळाचे पारीं, सुफळ संपूर्ण.</p>

<span class="devanagari"><span class="ss11"><p>जीवनीकार, समालोचक तथा अन्वेषक[सम्पादन गर्ने]
नेपाली साहित्यजगत्मा पहिलो जीवनीलेखक मोतीराम भट्ट हुन्। १९४८ सालमा भट्टले भानुभक्त आचार्यको जीवनीको पुस्तक लेखेका थिए। नेपाली साहित्यका आदि समालोचक नै मोतीराम भट्ट थिए। यिनले र्सवप्रथम भानुभक्तको रचनाको समालोचना गरी नेपाली साहित्यमा समालोचनाको आरम्भ गरेका थिए। भानुभक्तको जीवन-चरित्रमा खालि भानुभक्त आचार्यको जीवनीमात्र प्रस्तुत नगरी आचार्य का कवित्वशक्तिको मोतिरामले समालोचना गरेका छन्। त्यसै कृतिमा मोतीरामले भानुभक्तलाई आदरस्वरूप आदिकविको नामाङ्कन गरेका छन्। तर भानुभक्तभन्दा अघि पनि नेपाली भाषामा कविता लेख्ने कविहरू भएको हुँदा भानुभक्तलाई जातीय कवि भने न्याय होला। हुन त यसबारेमा मोतीराम भट्टले लेखेका पनि छन्- गोर्खाभाषामा हुन त धेरै नामका कवि भानुभक्तभन्दा पहिले भये तर कविताको मर्म जानी भाषापद्य लेखने कविहरूमा आदिकवि भानुभक्त नै हुन्।
<p>मोतीराम भट्ट नेपाली साहित्यका प्रथम अन्वेषक पनि हुन्। उनले नै भानुभक्तको बालकाण्ड रामायण फेला पारे। १७ वर्षको उमेर पार गरिसकेपछि उनी प्रायः भानुभक्तीय निष्ठामा एकोहोरो भएर लागे। त्यसै बेलादेखि उनले भानुभक्तसम्बन्धी जीवनी लेखे, पाण्डुलिपि खोजे। मोतीरामले नै भानुभक्तका वधूशिक्षा,भक्तमाला’,प्रश्नोत्तर’ र रामगीतालाई प्रकाशनमा ल्याएका थिए। यिनले भानुभक्तको अत्यन्तै गहिरिएर खोजिनीति गरे। भानुभक्तका अतिरिक्त यिनले बिहारीलाल, छविलाल, पतञ्जलि आदि व्यक्तिहरू पनि कवि भएको सूचना जनसमक्ष पुर्‍याएका थिए।
<p>साहित्य-सृजनामा यी आफ्ना दौँतरीहरूलाई नै अगि सारिरहन्थे। आफ्ना पूर्वज, समकालीन र पछाडिका मान्छेको उनी खुवै प्रशंसा गर्थे। यिनले भानुभक्तलाई कहीँ आदिकवि भनेका छन्, कहीँ कविकुलमुकुट भनेका छन् भने कहीँ चाहिँ चक्रचूडामणि पनि भनेका छन्। त्यसैगरी यिनले राजीवलोचन जोशीलाई कवि शिरोमणि र पद्मविलास पन्तलाई कवि भनेर सम्बोधन गरेका छन्। मोतिराम भट्टले आफूले मनले खाएको व्यक्तिको स्तुति गरेर कविता पनि लेखिदिन्थे। उनले भानुभक्त, राजीवलोचन र पद्मविलासको काव्यात्मक महिमा निकै राम्ररी गाएका छन्।<br>

<p>कवि, गजलकार तथा गायक[सम्पादन गर्ने]
<p>मोतीराम भट्टले श्रृङ्गर, भक्ति तथा राष्ट्रियताका विषयमा थुप्रै कविताहरू लेखे श्रृङ्गारिक कविताका चाहिँ उनी निर्मा ता नै बने। श्लोकसङ्ग्रह र मनोद्वेग प्रवाहमा मोतिराम भट्टका थुप्रै श्रृङ्गारिक कविता रहेका छन्। पिकदूत’ भट्टको श्रृङ्गाररसको अर्को काव्य हो। मोतीराम भट्टले नै नेपाली भाषामा गजलको आविष्कार गरे। यिनले नेपाली भाषामा थुप्रै गजल लेखेर लोकप्रिय बनाएका छन्। त्यस बेला यिनको गजललेखनबाट लक्ष्मीदत्त पन्त, गोपीनाथ लोहनी, नरदेव पाण्डे पनि आकर्षित भए र उनीहरूले पनि गजल लेख्न थाले। भट्टकै प्रेरणाबाट शम्भुप्रसाद ढुङ्गेल, भीमनिधि तिवारी र मवीवि शाहले पनि नेपाली काव्यविधामा गजललाई महत्त्वपूर्ण किसिमले प्राथमिकता दिए। भट्ट गजलकार मात्र नभएर गायक पनि थिए। त्यसबेला दरबारमा उर्दूका गीतगजल गाएको देखेर यिनले नेपाली गजलगीत लेखे र गाएर पनि प्रस्तुत गर्न थाले। दरबारमा पनि क्रमशः मोतीराम भट्टले लेखेका गजल चल्न थाले :
<p>यता हेर्‍यो यतै मेरा नजर्मा राम प्यारा छन् उता हेर्‍यो उतै मेरा नजर्मा राम प्यारा छन्। समस्यापूर्ति कार तथा सङ्गठनकर्ता[सम्पादन गर्ने] समस्यापूर्ति कविता लेख्ने जाँगर चलेपछि अरूलाई पनि यस विषयमा केन्द्रित गर्न उनले काठमाडौ तथा बनारस दुवै ठाउँमा मित्रमण्डलीको स्थापना गरे। संस्कृत वाङ्मयको पुरानो चलनलाई नेपाली भाषामा कायम गराउन उनी खुबै जुटे र समस्यापूर्तिको कविता सर्वप्रथम भट्टले नै आफै लेखे। बनारसमा बसेको बेला यिनले आफ्ना हितैषी साथीहरू तेजबहादुर, काशीनाथ, रङ्गनाथ, चेत सिंह र पद्मविलासलाई पनि समस्यापूर्तिका कविता लेख्न निपूर्ण बनाए। यिनले काठमाडौमा राजीवलोचन जोशी, भोजराज पाण्डे, डोलेश्वर, लक्ष्मीदत्त पन्त, नरदेव पाण्डे, कालीप्रसाद, देवराज र गोपीनाथ लोहनी आदिलाई पनि सङ्गठनात्मक रूपमा समस्यापूर्तिको कविता लेख्न वातावरण जुटाए। वास्तवमा उनीहरू पनि क्रमशः क्रमशः समस्यापूर्ति ’ कविता लेख्न निपुण भएका थिए।
<p>नाटककार तथा निर्देशक[सम्पादन गर्ने] मोतिराम भट्टले नेपाली भाषामा शकुन्तला’, प्रियदर्शिका र पद्मावती’ गरी तीनवटा नाटक लेखेका थिए। हुन त यिनले उर्दूमा पनि नाटक लेखेका थिए। शकुन्तला नाटक यिनले आफ्ना साथी देवशमशेर ज.ब.रा.को. अनुरोधमा लेखन र निर्देशन गरेका थिए। यिनले निर्देशन गरेको यो नाटक प्रधानमन्त्री वीरशमशेर ज.ब.रा.ले पनि हेरे। यो नाटक दरबारबाट पुनः बाहिर निस्केन। भनिन्छ देवशमशेरबाट नै यस नाटकलाई दबाइएको हुन सक्छ। जे होस् , मोतिराम भट्ट नाटकलेखनमा जति कुशल थिए निर्देशनकलामा पनि त्यति नै पोख्त थिए।
<p>सम्पादक, छापाखाना र पत्रिकाका प्रबन्धक तथा पुस्तकालयका निर्माता[सम्पादन गर्ने] मोतिराम भट्टले प्रायः भानुभक्त आचार्यका कृतिहरूको मात्र सम्पादन गरेको पाइन्छ। भानुभक्तको बालकाण्ड रामायण यिनैको सक्रियता, सौजन्य र भूमिगत सम्पादनमा प्रकाशित भएको थियो। भानुभक्तकृत भाषा रामायणको यिनैले सम्पादन गरेका थिए। त्यसैगरी मोतिरामले भानुभक्तका भक्तमाला, रामगीता, प्रश्नोत्तरा र वधूशिक्षाको पनि सम्पादन गरेका थिए।
<p>मोतिराम भट्टले नै पहिलो नेपाली मासिक पत्रिकाको प्रकाशनको प्रबन्ध गरे। यिनले निकालेको पत्रिकाको नाउँ थियो- गोरखा भारतजीवन र यो पत्रिका बनारसबाट प्रकाशित भएको थियो। यिनले बनारसका आफ्ना हितैषी मित्र रामकृष्ण बर्माको सहयोग लिएर भारतजीवननामक छापाखाना स्थापना गराए। त्यस छापाखानालाई यिनैले जिम्मा लिई यिनी आफू त्यसको प्रबन्धकका रूपमा बसे। भट्टले त्यही छापाखानाबाट भानुभक्तका कृतिहरू पनि छपाए। भट्टले यस छापाखानाबाट यसका स्वामी रामकृष्ण बर्मा लाई पनि निक्कै आर्थिक लाभ पुर्याएका थिए।
<p>मोतिरामले नेपालमा आफ्ना मामा कृष्णदेव पाण्डे र आफ्ना अभिन्न मित्र धीरेन्द्रसँग मिली ठहिटीमा पाशुपत छापाखानाको स्थापना गरे। १९५० सालमा खोलिएको यो छापाखाना त्यति बेलाको नेपालको प्रसिद्ध छापाखाना मानिएको छ। पाशुपत छापाखानाको स्थापनापश्चात् त्यहाँबाट नेपाली भाषासाहित्यका थुप्रै पुस्तक र पत्रिकाहरू छापिन थाले। आफ्ना मामा कृष्णदेव पाण्डेसँग मिलेर आफ्नो नाउँसमेत जोडी काठमाडौको ठहिटीमा यिनले एउटा पुस्तकालयको स्थापना गरे- मोतीकृष्ण कम्पनी। यिनले त्यस पुस्तकालयमा नेपाली भाषाका यथेष्ट पुस्तकहरू जोड्न थाले। मोतीकृष्ण कम्पनीबाट पुस्तकहरू पनि बेचिने कार्य हुन्थ्यो। उनले नेपाली भाषाको पहिलो पुस्तकालयको निर्माण गरेर नेपाली भाषासाहित्यको सेवा गरेका थिए।
<p>मोतिराम भट्ट नेपाली साहित्यप्रदेशका एउटा अलौ किक व्यक्तित्व थिए। उनी नेपाली भाषासाहित्यको सृजना, स•ठनका प्रेरक, श्रद्धेय र आधिकारिक पुरुष थिए। पढ्दै , पुस्तक लेख्तै, सम्पादन गर्दै, पत्रिका चलाउँदै , पुस्तकालय खोल्दै , छापाखानाको स्थापना गर्दै, अरूलाई लेख्न प्रेरणा दिँदै यिनले नेपाली धर्ती लाई बिर्सि नसक्नुको गुन लगाएका छन्। नेपालका लागि मरिमेट्ने उनी ठूला सपूत थिए। आफ्नो जीवनको अथक मिहिनेत, बौद्धिक कसरत र हिम्मतका कारणले उनी नेपाली माटोमा चिरस्मरणीय छन्। उनको योगदानका कारणले उनी यस देशका राष्ट्रिय विभूति बनेका छन्। उनका नाउँमा कैयौँ सङ्घसंस्था, बाटाघाटाको निर्माण भएका छन्। उनका नाउँमा हुलाक टिकट निकालिएको छ। उनैको नाउमा युवावर्ष मोती पुरस्कारसमेत स्थापना भएको छ जुन पुरस्कार नेपाली साहित्यका युवा पिँडीको सर्वोच्च पुरस्कारका रूपमा रहेको छ।
<p>बहुमुखी प्रतिभाका धनी मोतिराम भट्ट राष्ट्रभाषा नेपालीका पहिलो उत्थापक थिए। मोतिरामको सृजना, गोडमेल र जलमलका कारणले नेपाली भाषाले आजको स्थिति ओगटेको हो। उनको यो मुलुकप्रति अत्यन्तै ठूलो सद्भावना थियो। उनी कट्टर राष्ट्रवादी थिए [२]
<p>अचल् झन्डा फर्कोस् फरफर गरी कान्तिपुरिमा
रिपूको मन् थर्कोस् थरथर गरी छीन घरिमा
यवन्ले राज गर्दा कति पतित हिन्दूस्थल भयो
फगत् यो नेपाल्को मुलुक बचि कंचन् रहिगयो।

<p><em>Tacitus — De origine et situ Germanorum</em><br><br>
<em>Ⅰ</em><br>
Germania omnis a Gallis Rhaetisque et Pannoniis Rheno et Danubio fluminibus, a Sarmatis Dacisque mutuo metu aut montibus separatur: cetera Oceanus ambit, latos sinus et insularum immensa spatia complectens, nuper cognitis quibusdam gentibus ac regibus, quos bellum aperuit. Rhenus, Rhaeticarum Alpium inaccesso ac praecipiti vertice ortus, modico flexu in occidentem versus, septentrionali Oceano miscetur. Danubius, molli et clementer edito montis Abnobae jugo effusus, plures populos adit, donec in Ponticum mare sex meatibus erumpat: septimum os paludibus hauritur.<br><br>
<em>Ⅱ</em><br>
Ipsos Germanos indigenas crediderim, minimeque aliarum gentium adventibus et hospitiis mixtos; quia nec terra olim, sed classibus advehebantur, qui mutare sedes quaerebant, et immensus ultra, utque sic dixerim, adversus Oceanus raris ab orbe nostro navibus aditur. Quis porro, praeter periculum horridi et ignoti maris, Asia aut Africa aut Italia relicta, Germaniam peteret, informem terris, asperam coelo, tristem cultu aspectuque, nisi si patria sit? Celebrant carminibus antiquis (quod unum apud illos memoriae et annalium genus est) Tuisconem deum terra editum, et filium Mannum, originem gentis conditoresque. Manno tres filios assignant, e quorum nominibus proximi Oceano Ingaevones, medii Hermiones, ceteri Istaevones vocentur. Quidam autem, ut in licentia vetustatis, plures deo ortos pluresque gentis appellationes, Marsos, Gambrivios, Suevos, Vandalios, affirmant; eaque vera et antiqua nomina. Ceterum Germaniae vocabulum recens et nuper additum; quoniam, qui primi Rhenum transgressi Gallos expulerint, ac nunc Tungri, tunc Germani vocati sint: ita nationis nomen, non gentis evaluisse paulatim, ut omnes primum a victore ob metum, mox a seipsis invento nomine Germani vocarentur.<br><br>

<em>Ⅲ</em><br>
Fuisse apud eos et Herculem memorant, primumque omnium virorum fortium ituri in proelia canunt. Sunt illis haec quoque carmina, quorum relatu, quem baritum vocant, accendunt animos, futuraeque pugnae fortunam ipso cantu augurantur: terrent enim trepidantve, prout sonuit acies. Nec tam voces illae, quam virtutis concentus videntur. Affectatur praecipue asperitas soni et fractum murmur, objectis ad os scutis, quo plenior et gravior vox repercussu intumescat. Ceterum et Ulixem quidam opinantur longo illo et fabuloso errore in hunc Occanum delatum, adisse Germaniae terras, Asciburgiumque, quod in ripa Rheni situm hodieque incolitur, ab illo constitutum nominatumque. Aram quin etiam Ulixi consecratam, adjecto Laertae patris nomine, eodem loco olim repertam, monumentaque et tumulos quosdam Graecis litteris inscriptos in confinio Germaniae Rhaetiaeque adhuc exstare: quae neque confirmare argumentis, neque refellere in animo est: ex ingenio suo quisque demat, vel addat fidem.<br><br>

<em>Ⅳ</em><br>
Ipse eorum opinionibus accedo, qui Germaniae populos nullis aliis aliarum nationum connubiis infectos propriam et sinceram et tantum sui similem gentem exstitisse arbitrantur: unde habitus quoque corporum, quanquam in tanto hominum numero, idem omnibus; truces et cacrulei oculi, rutilae comae, magna corpora et tantum ad impetum valida; laboris atque operum non eadem patientia: minimeque sitim aestumque tolerare, frigora atque inediam coelo solove assueverunt.<br><br>

<em>Ⅴ</em><br>
Terra, etsi aliquanto specie differt, in universum tamen aut silvis horrida aut paludibus foeda: humidior, qua Gallias; ventosior, qua Noricum ac Pannoniam aspicit: satis ferax; frugiferarum arborum impatiens: pecorum fecunda, sed plerumque improcera; ne armentis quidem suus honor, aut gloria frontis: numero gaudent; eaeque solae et gratissimae opes sunt. Argentum et aurum propitii an irati dii aegaverint, dubito. Nec tamen affirmaverim, nullam Germaniae venam argentum aurumve gignere: quis enim scrutatus est? possessione et usu haud perinde afficiuntur. Est videre apud illos argentea vasa, legatis et principibus eorum muneri data, non in alia vilitate, quam quae humo finguntur quanquam proximi, ob usum commerciorum, aurum et argentum in pretio habent, formasque quasdam nostrae pecuniae agnoscunt atque eligunt: interiores simplicius et antiquius permutatione mercium utuntur. Pecuniam probant veterem et diu notam, serratos bigatosque. Argentum quoque, magis quam aurum sequuntur, nulla affectione animi, sed quia numerus argenteorum facilior usui est promiscua ac vilia mercantibus.<br><br>

<em>Ⅵ</em><br>
Ne ferrum quidem superest, sicut ex genere telorum colligitur. Rari gladiis aut majoribus lanceis utuntur: hastas, vel ipsorum vocabulo frameas gerunt, angusto et brevi ferro sed ita acri et ad usum habili, ut eodem telo, prout ratio poscit, vel cominus vel eminus pugnent: et eques quidem scuto frameaque contentus est: pedites et missilia spargunt, plura singuli, atque in immensum vibrant, nudi aut sagulo leves. Nulla cultus jactatio; scuta tantum lectissimis coloribus distinguunt: paucis loricae: vix uni alterive cassis aut galea. Equi non forma, non velocitate conspicui: sed nec variare gyros in morem nostrum docentur. In rectum, aut uno flexu dextros agunt ita conjuncto orbe, ut nemo posterior sit. In universum aestimanti, plus penes peditem roboris: eoque mixti proeliantur, apta et congruente ad equestrem pugnam velocitate peditum, quos ex omni juventute delectos ante aciem locant. Definitur et numerus: centeni ex singulis pagis sunt: idque ipsum inter suos vocantur; et quod primo numerus fuit, jam nomen et honor est. Acies per cuneos componitur. Cedere loco, dummodo rursus instes, consilii quam formidinis arbitrantur. Corpora suorum etiam in dubiis proeliis referunt. Scutum reliquisse, praecipuum flagitium; nec aut sacris adesse, aut concilium inire, ignominioso fas; multique superstites bellorum infamiam laqueo finierunt.<br><br>

<em>Ⅶ</em><br>
Reges ex nobilitate, duces ex virtute sumunt. Nec regibus infinita aut libera potestas: et duces exemplo potius, quam imperio, si prompti, si conspicui, si ante aciem agant, admiratione praesunt. Ceterum neque animadvertere neque vincire, ne verberare quidem, nisi sacerdotibus permissum; non quasi in poenam, nec ducis jussu, sed velut deo imperante, quem adesse bellantibus credunt: effigiesque et signa quaedam, detracta lucis, in proelium ferunt. Quodque praecipuum fortitudinis incitamentum est, non casus nec fortuita conglobatio turmam aut cuneum facit, sed familiae et propinquitates, et in proximo pignora, unde feminarum ululatus audiri, unde vagitus infantium: hi cuique sanctissimi testes, hi maximi laudatores. Ad matres, ad conjuges vulnera ferunt; nec illae numerare, aut exigere plagas pavent; cibosque et hortamina pugnantibus gestant.<br><br>

<em>Ⅷ</em><br>
Memoriae proditur, quasdam acies, inclinatas jam et labantes, a feminis restitutas, constantia precum et objectu pectorum et monstrata cominus captivitate, quam longe impatientius feminarum suarum nomine timent: adeo ut efficacius obligentur animi civitatum, quibus inter obsides puellae quoque nobiles imperantur. Inesse quin etiam sanctum aliquid et providum putant: nec aut consilia earum aspernantur, aut responsa negligunt. Vidimus sub divo Vespasiano Veledam diu apud plerosque numinis loco habitam. Sed et olim Auriniam et complures alias venerati sunt non adulatione, nec tanquam facerent deas.<br><br>

<em>Ⅸ</em><br>
Deorum maxime Mercurium colunt, cui certis diebus humanis quoque hostiis litare fas habent. Herculem ac Martem concessis animalibus placant: pars Suevorum et Isidi sacrificat. Unde causa et origo peregrino sacro parum comperi, nisi quod signum ipsum, in modum liburnae figuratum, docet advectam religionem. Ceterum nec cohibere parietibus deos, neque in ullam humani oris speciem assimulare, ex magnitudine coelestium arbitrantur: lucos ac nemora consecrant, deorumque nominibus appellant secretum illud, quod sola reverentia vident.</p>

<p><em>Ⅰ</em><br>
Sull’orlo di un lago bizzarro che io amo, verde ai due capi, sottile e torto per sinuose gole di colli selvaggi e di montagne tragiche, sereno a mezzo il corso nell’arco di un golfo idilliaco, si affaccia allo specchio maggiore delle acque una densa e signorile corona di ombra. Sovente per le vie solitarie di quell’ombra fui preso dal senso di una bellezza che più si prometta di quanto si sveli. Non la scoprivo intera nel tremolar lucente del lago tra i tronchi, nelle pensose montagne assise a levante del bosco, nelle alte scene lontane, dorate di sole, che mi apparivano tratto tratto a settentrione. Mi sorgeva invece nel cuore e me lo riempiva di sè l’idea di una possibile parola unica nella quale consuonassero tante diverse voci di cose; di una profonda parola di bellezza, tentante e inafferrabile come la parola di accordi musicali che annuncino, preparino una successiva rivelazione di suoni e invece si spengano senza seguito nel silenzio. Così penetrato dall’anima occulta delle cose che mi figuravo desiderosa e incapace di esprimersi a me com’ero io di comprender lei, movevo alla più recondita sede di quel regno di ombra dove i maggiori alberi, fronteggiandosi in giro, congiungendosi a grande altezza in un’ascensione unica, fanno di sè ghirlanda e tempio a un cupo fantasma.
<p>Una giovine donna, bellissima, dai capelli scomposti, dalle vesti cadenti, siede là sopra un alto seggio, piegato il busto gentile in avanti, puntati i gomiti alle ginocchia, strette le guance fra i pugni chiusi, fissi gli occhi tordidi nel vuoto. Il viso rivela una intelligenza forte che affonda nella follia. Nessuna cura stringe più costei nè del mondo nè di sè. Nessun vivente presuma, per esserle stato caro, poterle recar conforto. Ella non torcerebbe un momento gli occhi suoi avidi dalla visione di angoscia che la impietra; e tuttavia ci balena che possa repente balzar dal seggio con uno strido, avventarsi là dove guarda, tanto potente vita spirò nel marmo il grande artista che le pose nome «Desolazione». Si soffre davanti all’alta Dolorosa, e si gode intensamente di soffrire. Ci partiamo pensosi e la visione di lei ne persegue al sole, per le ombre che il vento scompiglia, lungo le rive sonore del lago scintillante. Non ci guasta l’incanto dei colori e dei suoni ma vi spira una malinconia segreta che lo rende più soave, infonde alle voci delle cose un accento nuovo e profondo. Pare che l’enigma di bellezza oscura onde avemmo dianzi turbato il cuore vi ritorni, lo prema più forte, quasi vi si disveli. I susurri del fogliame paiono prima dire dire incalzando e poi dolersi, nel venir meno, di non essere intesi.<br><br>

<em>Ⅱ</em><br>
Ma non è nel vento, è sulle labbra silenziose della bella creatura di marmo che ci si disegna la prima parola del mistero. Perchè costei che se fosse viva ci agghiaccerebbe il sangue con la sua vista, ci distruggerebbe l’incanto del giardino, perchè si mesce, fatta visione e opera d’arte, con la bellezza delle cose in un’armonia che ci muove al desiderio e al sospiro, a un turbamento non simile alla pietà, simile piuttosto alle inquietudini dell’amore nascente? S’ella fosse raffigurata nell’atto del pregare o del piangere, di una emozione insomma tenera e calda, si direbbe che l’attitudine sua genera il sentimento nostro; ma non è così. Il dolore e l’amore di lei, compenetrandosi a vicenda, si sono indurati in un’angoscia torva, senza tenerezza, senza fiamma. È forse la leggiadria del volto e del corpo che può tanto sopra di noi? No, la sua bellezza è troppo cupa, troppo sinistro il disordine dei suoi capelli e delle sue vesti. La potenza sua fascinatrice è nella grandiosità del suo dolore impersonale, senza nome. Ella non è una madre, non è un’amante, è il dolore stesso, è l’idea pura, fatta marmo, dell’universale dolore, del dolore che oscura presto o tardi ogni vita umana. Ma se l’idea pura del dolore, sensibilmente rappresentata dall’Arte, ne accende l’anima di pensieri alti e soavi, conviene che in lei si asconda qualche occulta bellezza; e poichè solo ha potenza di commuovere l’opera d’arte che fu creata nella commozione, convien pensare che il creatore di quel marmo abbia concepito con entusiasmo, prima di noi, una occulta bellezza del soffrire. Pure, se io potessi evocare dai morti Vincenzo Vela, l’artefice sovrano, e interrogarlo, egli mi risponderebbe di non avere pensato mai a una bellezza del soffrire.<br><br>

<em>Ⅲ</em><br>
Signori, le sorgenti della ispirazione artistica sfuggono alla coscienza stessa dell’artista. Esse si celano in una regione misteriosa dello spirito umano, nelle tenebre inferiori alla coscienza dove giacciono tesori di ricordanze oscurate e lampeggiano meravigliose facoltà del conoscere cui non sono ministri nè i sensi nè il ragionamento. Laggiù sono le inaccessibili fonti della ispirazione artistica insieme alle fonti degli oscuri presentimenti, della malinconia e della ilarità senza causa conosciuta, delle dolcezze mistiche. Di laggiù è balzata in un’ora di emozione creatrice questa mirabile forma cui l’artista, vagheggiandola e meditandola, condusse poi a perfezione squisita; e non è temerità di pensare che nelle ombre del subcosciente un’arcana bellezza del dolore fosse da lui appresa. Non è temerità di pensare che quando erravamo per i viali deserti ascoltando la voce del vento e delle onde colla mente piena della Desolata, una bellezza mistica del dolore fosse appresa da noi stessi, che pur non ne avevamo coscienza. Non esclamate, signori, ch’è temerario innalzare su questa sola pietra la strana dottrina di una bellezza recondita del dolore. No, io ho incominciato col parlarvi di quella pietra perchè il dolore vi si rivela nella sua forma più alta, la sofferenza morale, e perchè altro che dolore la sublime forma non dice; ma evochiamo insieme dalle reliquie dei secoli morti, dalle pagine degli antichi poeti le creature che l’Arte innamorata del dolore partorì nobili di bellezza immortale.<br><br>

<em>Ⅳ</em><br>
Esse ascendono in folla al richiamo, turbinano davanti a noi come le anime dolenti nel tenebroso vento che Dante ideò, e Voi tutte le riconoscete al viso, alle vesti, alle attitudini, perchè i loro nomi di gloria vi sono familiari. Io non so come si ardisca insegnare alle turbe in prosa e in rima che la visione artistica del dolore ha origini cristiane, che procede dalla glorificazione di un infame strumento di tortura e di morte, che l’arte antica fu solo una fioritura di bellezza serena e di gioia. Voi tutti sapete che non è vero. Altro che armoniose membra di Veneri caste e di efebi divini, altro che placide maestà di volti olimpici ha dato l’arte antica. Vedete Laocoonte che passa contorcendosi fra le spire dei draghi, levando al cielo ‘clamores horrendos’; vedete il bel guerriero ferito del Campidoglio che reclina tristemente il capo nelle ombre della morte, e se l’una opera e l’altra Vi paiono pensate e condotte dagli artefici a prova della loro scienza e della valente mano, se il dolore fisico Vi sembra predominar troppo in esse sul dolore morale, vedete Niobe che impietrata piange ancora secondo il tragico mito, piange spaventosamente per gli occhi di sasso, Niobe, il sempiterno dolore inflitto alla creatura umana dall’Invisibile, che innamorò di sè l’arte greca e la sua imitatrice latina. Ecco le creazioni dei grandi tragici. Prometeo, che soffre in fiero silenzio mentre i carnefici ne configgon le catene alla rupe e, appena è solo, caccia un urlo, chiama, come il profeta, le genti «Hidesthe me». «Attendite & videte». Ecco la frigia Cassandra, schiava nella reggia degli Atridi, ululante nel suo barbaro linguaggio quale una belva prigioniera. Ecco il dolore disceso fin nelle tombe a invader le ossa dei morti, il fantasma del vecchio re Dareios che piange con Atossa, la compagna sua tuttora vivente, sulle sventure del figlio Serse, e la dolce Elettra singhiozzante sopra una ciocca di capelli sconosciuti, Antigone e Ismene che a vicenda si eccitano al pianto. Ecco Edipo e l’ombra sinistra del Destino. E che è mai finalmente la tragedia greca se non la forma di bellezza onde si vestì un grandioso concetto del dolore e del suo ufficio nel mondo? Il dolore vi è rappresentato come un frutto inevitabile del disordine, come un castigo che persegue il sangue colpevole di generazione in generazione e punisce nell’infante in cuna il delitto degli avi. Lo spettacolo del soffrire fatale, immeritato dagli afflitti avvinse a sè la mente dei tragici di Atene e, per opera loro, il cuore del popolo. Certo quei grandi poeti non videro in esso che crudeli vendette divine e il volere del destino implacabile, non ebbero coscienza di un’azione provvidenziale e salutare del dolore; ma vi divinarono tuttavia la forma di un ordine onde non valevano a penetrare l’essenza. La stessa Iliade prende bellezza e grandezza sovrana dal suo elemento tragico, dal Fato che v’incombe agli uomini e agli Dei e il poeta di Achille non lo ha forse mai tanto amato come quando a lui, salito alle vendette sul suo carro di battaglia, fa profetare dal cavallo Xanto una sinistra profezia di sventura.
<p>Ed ecco tra i fantasmi omerici anche Ulisse pensoso in riva al mare colla cara lontana Itaca nel cuor pesante, e presso a lui Calipso, la triste impotenza dell’amore e della bellezza immortale contro un destino che mostra la felicità e la rifiuta. Ecco passar gemendo con i capelli al vento le creature ahimè troppo verbose della poesia elegiaca, nate dal fascino che il dolore ha esercitato, come soggetto d’arte, sull’anima pagana. Ecco la Musa malinconica e appassionata di Virgilio, una voluttuosa della tristezza, che sentì le lagrime delle cose, e si compiacque di ascoltar i lamenti dei boschi e dei laghi:<br><br>

<center>Te nemus Anguitiæ, vitrea te Fucinus unda<br>
Te liquidi flevere lacus:</center>

<p>che si arrestò sospirando a contemplar gl’insolubili enigmi dell’Universo, il mistero delle cause prime.</p>

<p><em>Étienne François Dralet « L’art du taupier »</em><br>
La zoologie range la Taupe dans la classe des mammifères, dans l’ordre des carnassiers, dans la famille des insectivores, dans la tribu des Talpidés, où elle constitue le genre Talpa, placé entre ceux Desman (Myogale) et Condylure (Condylura).
<p>Jusqu’à présent, on connaît trois espèces dans le genre Taupe: la Taupe Woogura, la Taupe aveugle et la Taupe d’Europe, ou commune.
<p>La Taupe Woogura (Talpa Woogura), récemment découverte au Japon, ne diffère de celle commune que par son pelage de couleur fauve sale et en ce qu’elle ne possède que trois paires d’incisives à chaque mâchoire, tandis que les deux autres espèces en ont quatre à la mâchoire inférieure; ses mœurs sont identiques.
<p>« La Taupe aveugle (Talpa cæca) est ainsi nommée, parce que son œil est recouvert par une membrane mince, translucide, percée en avant de la pupille d’un trou très-fin, non dilatable, par lequel on peut voir le globe de l’organe. Quant aux autres points de l’organisation, la Taupe aveugle se distingue peu de la Taupe vulgaire; elle aurait cependant la trompe plus longue, les incisives supérieures plus larges, les lèvres, les pieds et la queue blancs au lieu d’être gris. Son pelage épais et velouté est gris-noir foncé, la pointe des poils étant d’un noir brun; sa taille est la même que celle de la Taupe commune. » (A. E. Brehm, l’Homme et les animaux, t. Ier, p. 756–757.) [Illustration: Fig. 1.—La Taupe commune.]
<p>La Taupe commune ou d’Europe (Talpa Europæa) est un petit mammifère fouisseur, à corps long et cylindrique, à pattes très-courtes, à tête prolongée en avant en forme de groin ou de boutoir, avec des yeux si petits et si bien cachés sous les poils qu’on a longtemps nié leur existence, dépourvue de conque de l’oreille externe, munie enfin d’un simple rudiment de queue. Son corps est recouvert d’un poil fin, serré, court, mou, imitant le velours, de couleur noire avec des reflets grisâtres et rougeâtres; la longueur totale, du bout du nez à l’extrémité de la queue, est de om, 15 à om, 16 chez les adultes.
<p>« La Taupe commune se trouve dans toute l’Europe, à quelques exceptions près, et arrive jusque dans l’Asie centrale et septentrionale. Beaucoup de naturalistes ne voient dans la Taupe américaine qu’une variété de notre espèce. En Europe, le midi de la France, la Lombardie et le nord de l’Italie dessinent sa limite méridionale. De là, elle remonte vers le nord jusqu’à Dovrefjeld; en Grande-Bretagne, jusque vers l’Écosse centrale; en Russie, jusqu’au milieu du bassin de la Dwina. Elle manque complétement dans les Orcades, les Shetlands, la plus grande partie des Hébrides et en Islande. En Asie, elle va du Caucase jusqu’à la Léna. Dans les Alpes, elle monte jusqu’à une altitude de 2,000 mètres. Partout elle est commune et se multiplie d’une manière surprenante, là où elle n’a pas d’ennemis. » (Brehm, ut supra, p. 747.)
<p>Il ne sera pas sans intérêt pour les agriculteurs d’étudier successivement les principaux points de l’organisation et l’ensemble des mœurs de cet animal.
<p>La Taupe est un animal fouisseur: elle ne peut vivre et se reproduire qu’en creusant dans le sol des galeries souterraines, des gîtes et des nids, plus ou moins longs et spacieux. Aussi la nature l’a-t-elle spécialement construite pour ces fonctions; elle l’a dotée d’une clavicule large et courte, supportée par une lame verticale provenant du sternum; l’humérus, très-court, est fortement renflé à ses deux bouts et renvoyé latéralement; le radius est également court et robuste, le cubitus a la forme d’une lame prolongée en avant par un fort onglet transversal qui n’est que la transformation de l’olécrane. Enfin, la courbure, la situation latérale de l’humérus, la disposition des muscles en général et des muscles peaussiers en particulier, élèvent le coude plus haut que l’épaule et amènent la paume de la main en dehors.
<p>La main, et c’est bien véritablement une main, présente une longueur égale à sa largeur. Les phalanges métacarpiennes et digitales sont formées d’osselets courts à têtes articulaires, et se terminent par une phalange onguéale droite, acuminée, convexe en dessus, taillée en bec de flûte en dessous, longue et forte; enfin un fort osselet en forme de fer de serpe, né de l’extrémité du radius, vient s’insérer près de l’ongle du pouce. Cette main merveilleuse sert à fouir, et pour cela, elle est conformée à la fois comme une pioche et comme une pelle, elle est munie d’ongles longs et puissants, elle fonctionne d’avant et de côté en arrière; mais elle sert aussi à la marche et même à une marche rapide, en se plaçant perpendiculairement au sol sur lequel elle s’appuie avec l’extrémité des ongles.
<p>Le membre postérieur se rapproche bien plus, par sa conformation, des membres analogues des autres mammifères. Le bassin est allongé, ouvert par devant et soudé par l’ilium avec les vertèbres sacrées; le fémur est allongé et offre deux fortes têtes articulaires; le tibia est long et fort, et son péroné, développé en haut, se confond avec lui en bas. Le pied est étroit, allongé, placé d’aplomb sous le ventre; il est terminé par des ongles droits, longs et très-aigus; on y trouve, comme à la main, mais plus grêle et à l’état rudimentaire, un petit osselet surnuméraire. Le pied peut venir en aide à la main, dans l’action de fouiller, et servir à pousser la terre de côté; il sert aussi à la marche et se pose sur toute la plante, le membre postérieur donnant l’impulsion principale au corps tout entier.
<p>La main forme pour la Taupe une pioche à la fois et une pelle; mais elle est encore aidée dans ces fonctions par la tête, dont la mâchoire supérieure se termine en museau allongé, en boutoir ou en groin, assez comparable à celui du porc et du sanglier. Ce museau est recouvert par la peau, dont le panicule charnu est très-développé aussi bien que les muscles vertébraux; grâce à cette disposition, la Taupe, douée d’une force énorme pour renverser sa tête en arrière, se sert de ce museau pour soulever le sol après l’avoir désagrégé et l’amonceler à la surface de la galerie ou du nid; c’est à la fois une pince, une tarière et une pelle, organe à la fois de préhension, de fouissage et d’extraction.
<p>Puisque nous nous occupons de la tête, traitons des sens qui y ont leur siége. Au premier rang, il faut placer celui de l’odorat, qui s’est développé aux dépens de celui de la vue. Le mufle s’est allongé et converti en boutoir, presque en trompe; les cavités nasales s’élargissent en arrière, reposant sur un ethmoïde étendu et contenant des cornets volumineux et repliés en nombreuses et fines volutes; les tubercules olfactifs du cerveau présentent un développement inaccoutumé. Dans sa vie souterraine, en effet, la Taupe avait besoin d’un odorat subtil pour se diriger vers sa proie, la guetter, la deviner et l’atteindre.
<p>Le vers de Virgile:
<center>Monstrum horrendum, informe, ingens, cui lumen ademptum,</center>
<p>pourrait presque caractériser la Taupe, et longtemps on a considéré cet animal comme privé de l’organe et du sens de la vue; on sait aujourd’hui qu’elle est douée d’un œil très-petit, il est vrai, que cachent les poils, mais qui est un œil véritable et ne différant guère de celui des autres mammifères que par un développement plus restreint. Cet œil présente une pupille elliptique et verticale; la cornée est plus saillante que chez les oiseaux, le cristallin plus convexe que chez les mammifères, ce qui tendrait à constituer un œil myope, bien en accord avec le milieu dans lequel vit l’animal. Nous avons vu que, chez la Taupe dite aveugle, la vision ne s’opère qu’à travers un trou très-fin, ouverture non dilatable, percée dans une membrane très-mince qui recouvre tout le globe oculaire.
<p>Le sens de l’audition vient, pour la Taupe, comme importance, après celui de l’olfaction; il est indispensable à sa sécurité. Il ne paraît point qu’il y ait d’oreille externe; mais s’il n’y a aucun rudiment de conque, on peut remarquer, sous le poil, une ouverture pratiquée à la peau; c’est un méat auditif, l’orifice d’un canal qui, après quelques sinuosités sous la peau, aboutit dans l’oreille osseuse; ce canal à parois musculeuses et cartilagineuses n’est qu’une conque placée intérieurement. C’est encore une adaptation des organes aux milieux.
<p>Quant au sens du goût, le palais présente une vaste surface, et la langue le pouvant recouvrir en entier, palais et langue étant tapissés d’une muqueuse qui ne paraît rien présenter d’anormal, il y a tout lieu de supposer que la gustation s’exerce chez la Taupe comme chez la plupart des mammifères et au même degré.</p>

<span class="ss02"><p><em>Gabriel García Márquez «Cien años de soledad»</em><br>
Muchos años después, frente al pelotón de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buendía había de recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llevó a conocer el hielo. Macondo era entonces una aldea de veinte casas de barro y cañabrava construidas a la orilla de un río de aguas diáfanas que se precipitaban por un lecho de piedras pulidas, blancas y enormes como huevos prehistóricos. El mundo era tan reciente, que muchas cosas carecían de nombre, y para mencionarlas había que señalarías con el dedo. Todos los años, por el mes de marzo, una familia de gitanos desarrapados plantaba su carpa cerca de la aldea, y con un grande alboroto de pitos y timbales daban a conocer los nuevos inventos. Primero llevaron el imán. Un gitano corpulento, de barba montaraz y manos de gorrión, que se presentó con el nombre de Melquiades, hizo una truculenta demostración pública de lo que él mismo llamaba la octava maravilla de los sabios alquimistas de Macedonia. Fue de casa en casa arrastrando dos lingotes metálicos, y todo el mundo se espantó al ver que los calderos, las pailas, las tenazas y los anafes se caían de su sitio, y las maderas crujían por la desesperación de los clavos y los tornillos tratando de desenclavarse, y aun los objetos perdidos desde hacía mucho tiempo aparecían por donde más se les había buscado, y se arrastraban en desbandada turbulenta detrás de los fierros mágicos de Melquíades. «Las cosas, tienen vida propia pregonaba el gitano con áspero acento, todo es cuestión de despertarles el ánima.» José Arcadio Buendía, cuya desaforada imaginación iba siempre más lejos que el ingenio de la naturaleza, y aun más allá del milagro y la magia, pensó que era posible servirse de aquella invención inútil para desentrañar el oro de la tierra. Melquíades, que era un hombre honrado, le previno: «Para eso no sirve.» Pero José Arcadio Buendía no creía en aquel tiempo en la honradez de los gitanos, así que cambió su mulo y una partida de chivos por los dos lingotes imantados. Úrsula Iguarán, su mujer, que contaba con aquellos animales para ensanchar el desmedrado patrimonio doméstico, no consiguió disuadirlo. «Muy pronto ha de sobrarnos oro para empedrar la casa», replicó su marido. Durante varios meses se empeñó en demostrar el acierto de sus conjeturas. Exploró palmo a palmo la región, inclusive el fondo del río, arrastrando los dos lingotes de hierro y recitando en voz alta el conjuro de Melquíades. Lo único que logró desenterrar fue una armadura del siglo ⅩⅤ con todas sus partes soldadas por un cascote de óxido, cuyo interior tenía la resonancia hueca de un enorme calabazo lleno de piedras. Cuando José Arcadio Buendía y los cuatro hombres de su expedición lograron desarticular la armadura, encontraron dentro un esqueleto calcificado que llevaba colgado en el cuello un relicario de cobre con un rizo de mujer.
<p>En marzo volvieron los gitanos. Esta vez llevaban un catalejo y una lupa del tamaño de un tambor, que exhibieron como el último descubrimiento de los judíos de Amsterdam. Sentaron una gitana en un extremo de la aldea e instalaron el catalejo a la entrada de la carpa. Mediante el pago de cinco reales, la gente se asomaba al catalejo y veía a la gitana al alcance de su mano. «La ciencia ha eliminado las distancias», pregonaba Melquíades. «Dentro de poco, el hombre podrá ver lo que ocurre en cualquier lugar de la tierra, sin moverse de su casa.» Un mediodía ardiente hicieron una asombrosa demostración con la lupa gigantesca: pusieron un montón de hierba seca en mitad de la calle y le prendieron fuego mediante la concentración de los rayos solares. José Arcadio Buendía, que aún no acababa de consolarse por el fracaso de sus imanes, concibió la idea de utilizar aquel invento como un arma de guerra. Melquíades, otra vez, trató de disuadirlo. Pero terminó por aceptar los dos lingotes imantados y tres piezas de dinero colonial a cambio de la lupa. Úrsula lloró de consternación. Aquel dinero formaba parte de un cofre de monedas de oro que su padre había acumulado en toda una vida de privaciones, y que ella había enterrado debajo de la cama en espera de una buena ocasión para invertirías. José Arcadio Buendía no trató siquiera de consolarla, entregado por entero a sus experimentos tácticos con la abnegación de un científico y aun a riesgo de su propia vida. Tratando de demostrar los efectos de la lupa en la tropa enemiga, se expuso él mismo a la concentración de los rayos solares y sufrió quemaduras que se convirtieron en úlceras y tardaron mucho tiempo en sanar. Ante las protestas de su mujer, alarmada por tan peligrosa inventiva, estuvo a punto de incendiar la casa. Pasaba largas horas en su cuarto, haciendo cálculos sobre las posibilidades estratégicas de su arma novedosa, hasta que logró componer un manual de una asombrosa claridad didáctica y un poder de convicción irresistible. Lo envió a las autoridades acompañado de numerosos testimonios sobre sus experiencias y de varios pliegos de dibujos explicativos, al cuidado de un mensajero que atravesó la sierra, y se extravió en pantanos desmesurados, remontó ríos tormentosos y estuvo a punto de perecer bajo el azote de las fieras, la desesperación y la peste, antes de conseguir una ruta de enlace con las mulas del correo. A pesar de que el viaje a la capital era en aquel tiempo poco menos que imposible, José Arcadio Buendia prometía intentarlo tan pronto como se lo ordenara el gobierno, con el fin de hacer demostraciones prácticas de su invento ante los poderes militares, y adiestrarlos personalmente en las complicadas artes de la guerra solar. Durante varios años esperó la respuesta. Por último, cansado de esperar, se lamentó ante Melquíades del fracaso de su iniciativa, y el gitano dio entonces una prueba convincente de honradez: le devolvió los doblones a cambio de la lupa, y le dejó además unos mapas portugueses y varios instrumentos de navegación. De su puño y letra escribió una apretada síntesis de los estudios del monje Hermann, que dejó a su disposición para que pudiera servirse del astrolabio, la brújula y el sextante. José Arcadio Buendía pasó los largos meses de lluvia encerrado en un cuartito que construyó en el fondo de la casa para que nadie perturbara sus experimentos. Habiendo abandonado por completo las obligaciones domésticas, permaneció noches enteras en el patio vigilando el curso de los astros, y estuvo a punto de contraer una insolación por tratar de establecer un método exacto para encontrar el mediodía. Cuando se hizo experto en el uso y manejo de sus instrumentos, tuvo una noción del espacio que le permitió navegar por mares incógnitos, visitar territorios deshabitados y trabar relación con seres espléndidos, sin necesidad de abandonar su gabinete. Fue ésa la época en que adquirió el hábito de hablar a solas, paseándose por la casa sin hacer caso de nadie, mientras Úrsula y los niños se partían el espinazo en la huerta cuidando el plátano y la malanga, la yuca y el ñame, la ahuyama y la berenjena. De pronto, sin ningún anuncio, su actividad febril se interrumpió y fue sustituida por una especie de fascinación. Estuvo varios días como hechizado, repitiéndose a sí mismo en voz baja un sartal de asombrosas conjeturas, sin dar crédito a su propio entendimiento. Por fin, un martes de diciembre, a la hora del almuerzo, soltó de un golpe toda la carga de su tormento. Los niños habían de recordar por el resto de su vida la augusta solemnidad con que su padre se sentó a la cabecera de la mesa, temblando de fiebre, devastado por la prolongada vigilia y por el encono de su imaginación, y les reveló su descubrimiento.
<p>—La tierra es redonda como una naranja.
<p>Úrsula perdió la paciencia. «Si has de volverte loco, vuélvete tú solo -gritó-. Pero no trates de inculcar a los niños tus ideas de gitano.» José Arcadio Buendía, impasible, no se dejó amedrentar por la desesperación de su mujer, que en un rapto de cólera le destrozó el astrolabio contra el suelo. Construyó otro, reunió en el cuartito a los hombres del pueblo y les demostró, con teorías que para todos resultaban incomprensibles, la posibilidad de regresar al punto de partida navegando siempre hacia el Oriente. Toda la aldea estaba convencida de que José Arcadio Buendía había perdido el juicio, cuando llegó Melquíades a poner las cosas en su punto. Exaltó en público la inteligencia de aquel hombre que por pura especulación astronómica había construido una teoría ya comprobada en la práctica, aunque desconocida hasta entonces en Macondo, y como una prueba de su admiración le hizo un regalo que había de ejercer una influencia terminante en el futuro de la aldea: un laboratorio de alquimia.
<p>Para esa época, Melquíades había envejecido con una rapidez asombrosa. En sus primeros viajes parecía tener la misma edad de José Arcadio Buendia. Pero mientras éste conservaba su fuerza descomunal, que le permitía derribar un caballo agarrándolo por las orejas, el gitano parecía estragado por una dolencia tenaz. Era, en realidad, el resultado de múltiples y raras enfermedades contraídas en sus incontables viajes alrededor del mundo. Según él mismo le contó a José Arcadio Buendia mientras lo ayudaba a montar el laboratorio, la muerte lo seguía a todas partes, husmeándole los pantalones, pero sin decidirse a darle el zarpazo final. Era un fugitivo de cuantas plagas y catástrofes habían flagelado al género humano. Sobrevivió a la pelagra en Persia, al escorbuto en el archipiélago de Malasia, a la lepra en Alejandría, al beriberi en el Japón, a la peste bubónica en Madagascar, al terremoto de Sicilia y a un naufragio multitudinario en el estrecho de Magallanes. Aquel ser prodigioso que decía poseer las claves de Nostradamus, era un hombre lúgubre, envuelto en un aura triste, con una mirada asiática que parecía conocer el otro lado de las cosas. Usaba un sombrero grande y negro, como las alas extendidas de un cuervo, y un chaleco de terciopelo patinado por el verdín de los siglos. Pero a pesar de su inmensa sabiduría y de su ámbito misterioso, tenía un peso humano, una condición terrestre que lo mantenía enredado en los minúsculos problemas de la vida cotidiana. Se quejaba de dolencias de viejo, sufría por los más insignificantes percances económicos y había dejado de reír desde hacía mucho tiempo, porque el escorbuto le había arrancado los dientes. El sofocante mediodía en que reveló sus secretos, José Arcadio Buendía tuvo la certidumbre de que aquél era el principio de una grande amistad. Los niños se asombraron con sus relatos fantásticos. Aureliano, que no tenía entonces más de cinco años, había de recordarlo por el resto de su vida como lo vio aquella tarde, sentado contra la claridad metálica y reverberante de la ventana, alumbrando con su pro- funda voz de órgano los territorios más oscuros de la imaginación, mientras chorreaba por sus sienes la grasa derretida por el calor. José Arcadio, su hermano mayor, había de transmitir aquella imagen maravillosa, como un recuerdo hereditario, a toda su descendencia. Úrsula, en cambio, conservó un mal recuerdo de aquella visita, porque entró al cuarto en el momento en que Melquíades rompió por distracción un frasco de bicloruro de mercurio.</p></span>

<p><em>Llorenç Riber «Els camins del paradís perdut»</em><br>
<span class="case">EN QUINA MANERA VINGUÉ A SANT BRANDAN EL DESIG DE CERCAR EL PARADÍS PERDUT.</span><br>
Mossenyer Sant Brandan fou home de gran penitència i d’estreta abstinència i de molta virtut; i regia, amb l’imperi de sa crossa abacial, una lenta ramada negrejant de tres milia monjos. Una volta s’esdevingué que a l’hora de vespres arribà al monestir que governava el sant abad, un monjo d’edat madura, i de bona vida i d’estranya terra, qui havia nom Barint, i era son nebot. El dit sant Brandan li demanà de moltes coses, ço és, què era estat, què li havia esdevingut; i si mai havia vista o oïda alguna meravella. Com fos que el sant oncle el pregàs molt carament i amorosa, llavors el dit Barint començà a plorar i se gità per terra i s’anegà en profunda oració, en la qual va romandre com esbalaït. Graciosament Sant Brandan el prengué en sos braços i l’aixecà, i li va dir, amb un besar mel·lifluent, aquestes gracioses paraules: —¿Quina és, fill, la causa d’aquesta tan greu fellonia? ¿Creus que el teu adveniment ens ha fet enuig? Certa cosa és que de la teva vinguda gran plaer n’haguérem. Per ço s’és menester que a tots nosaltres donis alegria i consolació, i ens diguis alguna bona paraula de Déu d’on la nostra ànima en pasturi; i que ens recontis les diverses meravelles que veieres en les partides i en les errors de la mar oceana per on navegares llargament.- A l’encariment d’aquesta petició poderosa com un conjur, s’abellí l’esquerp Barint, el qual trencant el silenci, començà a espandir-se en paraules abundants. I va dir:
<p>—Mon fill Menoc era el procurador dels pobres del Crist. Com fos desitjós de major solitud, fugí del nostre cenobi, i camina, caminaràs, a la bella ventura, trobà una illa, no gaire lluny d’una muntanya, la qual hom anomena Lapifil. Embolcallada per un cel indulgent aquesta illa és sobiranament delitosa. L’amor del cel i la tendra verdor de la terra l’hi retingueren; i hi sojornà gran temps. Durant el qual, arribà fins a mi un novell ardit, ço és, que el monjo fugitiu comandava gran multitud de monjos sota la seva preladia i que Déu mostrava per ell grans signes i miracles. La qual cosa suscità en mon cor irrefrenable enyorament de veure’l; i en vaig pendre el camí. Com ja hi era prop, Déu li revelà l’arribada meva i prevenint-la de tres jorns, m’exí a carrera amb sos germans. Anàvem embarcats en nau. Quan la nau s’acostà a la dita illa, veiérem que de diverses partides, vestits diversament, eixint-nos a camí, venien companyes de monjos, contínues com un formiguer qui emigra; brunzents i denses com un eixam. Diversament vestits i arribant de contrades diverses, emperò combregaven en una fe i en una esperança i en una caritat. Tenien una església on s’ajuntaven per l’ofici divinal. I no menjaven altra cosa sinó pa i nous i arrels d’herba. Cantaven aquests monjos les completes ensems, i després se recloïen en llurs cel·les. Cascún tenia la seva, i allà s’estava en oració fins el prim-son. Al cant primer del gall reposaven una mica. Jo i mon fillol trescàrem tota la illa; i la trescàrem tant que arribàrem a la vorera del mar, a la banda d’occident. Allà tenia ell la nau on s’era embarcat; i me va dir: —Mon pare, muntau en nau i naveguem cap a Llevant, cap a aquella illa que és dita Terra de promissió dels sants, la qual havem de donar als nostres successors qui vindran després de nosaltres.
<p>Muntàrem en la nau. Encara no hi érem, quan al nostre entorn, escampadissa, una boira s’espargí. Era humida i flonja, lleugera com la cendra, flairosa i blanca com un torterol d’aubaïna matinal. Tan espessa era que obturava l’esguard encaradís, i a penes podia veure hom la distància que hi ha de proa a popa. Per espai d’una hora durà aquesta blancura vaporosa. Traspassada la calitja, un esclat de llum ens inundà. I ens semblà veure, lluny, dins la claror viva, tremoladissa de besllums, una terra dilatada i verdejant. Vorejàvem la costa delitosa: ombra de penyals blaus, clara i fresca i regalant, com l’aigua clara; ombra perfumada de brancatges perfumats; el singlot de l’aigua musical en la por inviolada de les coves; volior d’unes grans aus, blanques i lentes, qui amb llur dolçura gutural amoixaven l’aire i coronaven la nau amb una viva garlanda d’ales. En el recés d’una cala, amorosa i rodona com un pit, pura i sonant com una cítara, en l’arena d’or blanca de lliris, posàrem el peu. I ens enfonsàrem en el misteri de la solitud. No hi havia herba sense rou, ni planta sense flor ni branca sense fruita. Per espai de quinze dies vagàrem per aquella deserta amenitat, i ens deixàrem perdre, sota les altes arcades vegetals, entre les soques, damunt l’herba viva intacta, que cruixia sota els nostres peus amb un petit gemec humà. Entre l’escampada verdor de l’herbei, les pedres suaus i llises, que eren gemmes, guaitaven amb pupil·la vària: enormes safirs que ens miraven amb la gran ullada blava; topacis, amb la ullada de foc amorós qui amoixa i no crema. Al terme d’aquells quinze dies ens trobàrem a la vora d’un gran riu. Decorria, ample i solemnial, amb profundes aigues mudes. Per anar més enllà, a l’altra riba, no hi havia enlloc gual ni passatge. Esperàrem el consell de Déu. Un bell home jove i resplendent se’ns mostrà, el qual ens saludà graciosament pel propi nom i després va dir: —¡Siau els benvinguts, servents de Déu, monjos germans! Gran mercè us ha feta el Senyor de mostrar-vos aquesta terra. És aquella terra que cercàveu, que donarà als seus sants. A saber haveu que el riu la migparteix. La meitat n’és aquesta banda on sou. Déu vos en guard però, de passar més envant. Preneu-ho en paciència i tornau-vos-en arrera, allà d’on sou vinguts.- ço digué el donzell; i aleshores un dels monjos qui amb nosaltres eren vinguts gosà demanar-li d’on ell era i quin nom havia. Ell li diu: —Per què em demanes d’on som ni quin nom he? Demana’m més tost noves d’aquesta illa i serà millor. I si ho vols saber, en la manera que ara la veus, és des del començament del món.- I llavors me diu a mi: —¿Tens fretura de menjar ni de beure ni de vestir? Sàpies que ço que et diré és veritat. No tens fam ni set ni t’és mester vestir ni dormir, jatsia que fassi un any que arribares en aquesta illa amb tos germans; i no has menjat ni begut ni la son agreujà tos ulls, ni has vist la nit arribada. A saber has que en aquest lloc no hi ha mai nit, ans sempre és dia; ni mai no hi plou ni mai el cel és entelat de núvol; la fam i la set, la son i la malaltia en són exilades. Aquí hi fa tot temps un bell i fresc estar. Aquí hom no hi envelleix ni hi mor. Una gran llum purpúrea vesteix tota la illa. Aquesta llum no és la rossa del sol ni la blanca i freda de la lluna, ni la celístia vaga dels estels; ans és la llum de Déu Nostre Senyor, del qual naixen tots els béns i totes les gràcies i totes les llums. Ell us ha feta gran mercè, car no tothom és digne de veure i sentir ço que vosaltres heu sentit i heu vist.
<p>Així parlà; i encontinent demostrà gran desig de partir-se de nosaltres i encara afegí: —Anau-vos-en d’ací; i jo vindré amb vosaltres fins a la ribera i a la vostra petita nau.- Arribats a la vorera entràrem en la nau. I s’esvaní el donzell com una imatge de somni. Començàrem de navegar; i al cap d’una hora, ens tornà envair aquella aubaïna nuvolosa de l’altre cop, i avençant a la ventura de Déu tornàrem a trobar els nostres germans. Els quals ens havien esperat amb incansable enyorament, i mostraren gran alegria del nostre retorn. I per ço com la nostra absència era estada tan llarga havien plorat i fet molts de pensaments. I duien bé el compte del temps que forem absents, que era d’un any i divuit dies. I ens començaren a dir: —Mossenyers i pares nostres, ¿on sou anats i on sou estats tant de temps? I ¿per què ens haveu deixat sense guia ni pastor en aquesta selva obscura? Nosaltres bé sabíem que mossenyor el nostre abad, espesses vegades, sol partir, i se’n va algunes voltes tot sol, no sabem on, ni si és lluny ni si és prop; i a vegades s’hi està un mes i ha pics que s’hi està dues setmanes i tal volta una setmana o encara menys, i després retorna sa i sau. Però ara s’hi ha estat un any; no és cosa, doncs, de meravellar si nosaltres érem en ànsia i en congoixa.
<p>Jo els vaig donar conhort i confort amb aquestes paraules: —Portador som de bones noves. En aquest viatge no m’ha advingut res que no sia per bé. A bon lloc sou. Sapiau que no és lluny d’ací aquella illa delitosa anomenada Terra de promissió dels Sants; i en aquesta illa no hi ha mai nit, ni mai el jorn s’hi acluca: llum rutilant i serenor sense núvol perdurablement imperen; no callen mai els aucellets de cantar la primavera; l’herba tota floreix; els arbres tots floreixen i fruiten. Un àngel de Déu, meravellós de veure, guarda la illa i ningú pot anar-hi si no en té llicència d’ell. Per l’olor dels nostres hàbits no coneixeu que som estats en Paradís? —Don abad- els monjos respongueren; —per l’olor del vostre hàbit coneguérem que haveu estat en lloc florent. Amb gust sabríem de vós on és aquest paradís, que nosaltres no el sabem i deim-vos que quaranta dies ha durat l’olor dels vostres vestits quan sou estats de retorn del lloc on éreu. —Ell respongué: —Amb mon car fill Menoc, en la illa delitosa, fórem tot aquest temps, sense menjar ni sense beure ni sense dormir; i érem tan alegres i consolats de ço que vèiem, que érem sadolls i plens com si haguéssim menjat a talent i voler. Passada aquella quarentena, rebí la bendicció dels monjos i prenguí comiat de mon car fill Menoc, i amb mos germans, retorní al cenobi i a l’estretura de ma cel·la.
<p>Havent Sant Brandan sentides totes aquestes coses meravelloses, se gità a terra i lloant Déu va dir: —Beneït sia el Senyor Déu en tots sos camins, i santificat en totes les seues obres, puix a sos servents revelà tals coses i de tal meravella. I encara sia beneït en sos dons puix avui ens apeixí amb esperitual pastura i bevenda.- Finides aquestes paraules, Sant Brandan no res menys digué: —Anem ara a menjar, segons la nostra usança, coses corporals.- I així fou fet. Després donà la benedicció als monjos; donà comiat a son nebot Barint i ell se n’entrà, consirós, en sa cel·la.</p></div>

<h1>Português</h1>
<p><em>‘Vasco da Gama’ by David Corazzi</em><br>
Entre as causas que espertaram o animo e brio dos portuguezes para se abalançarem á empreza dos descobrimentos, podem apontar-se como principaes: o desejo de dilatar a fé christã em todo o mundo conhecido; a sêde de gloria e de renome; a ambição de grangear fortuna conduzindo para o reino as especiarias, o ouro e pedras preciosas em que abundam as regiões orientaes; e a curiosidade de desvendar os segredos da natureza n’aquellas remotissimas paragens.
<p>E não se julgue que as navegações do seculo ⅩⅤ foram iniciadas sem plano, sem destino. Pelo contrario. Os nossos intrepidos mareantes levavam a sua rota já marcada, e não levantavam ferro sem se aperceberem de todos os conhecimentos e apparelhos necessarios ao cosmographo. A cultura intellectual do povo portuguez attingira o grau de desenvolvimento bastante grande para acompanhar o movimento scientifico e litterario das mais adiantadas nações da Europa, e com as suas viagens n’aquella época teve principio a historia verdadeira das navegações ao longo da Africa. Até ali tudo é vago, indeciso, fabuloso.
<p>Portugal estava mais proximo, que nenhum outro povo, do litoral africano; tinha já tomado Ceuta; dobrara o cabo Bojador; e sabia, em virtude da passagem do cabo da Boa Esperança, que existia communicação entre o Atlantico e o mar das Indias. Por tudo isto nutria no peito a generosa aspiração de levar o nome da patria e do filho de Maria aos paizes em que nasce a aurora. Tal era o desejo, a vontade nacional. Ora, sempre que um povo nutre uma idéa grandiosa, surge de entre a multidão um ‘grande homem’, o qual é—porque assim digamos—a personalisação do sentimento popular. Esse grande homem, esse representante da vontade unica de todos os portuguezes foi Vasco da Gama.
<p>Affirmam os chronistas que elle nasceu em Sines, e que teve por paes a Estevão da Gama e Isabel Sodré; e ainda que pouco escrevam, d’onde possamos inferir como correra a sua infancia e puericia, é comtudo facil presumir que principiou a sua carreira nos mares da Africa, e que sendo encarregado de negocios importantes, d’elles se desempenhou a contento do seu rei. A biographia de Vasco da Gama só é clara quando el-rei D. Manuel o escolheu para levar a cabo a empreza que sonhara. O facto de haver sido eleito pelo monarcha ‘afortunado’ bem mostra que o Gama era navegante experimentado, e de animo feito e capaz de grandes cousas. E assim acontecia. Entre as qualidades que lhe adornavam o espirito, avultavam a energia com que exercia o mando, a constancia nos designios, e a inflexibilidade na administração da justiça.
<p>Assomado de genio, commetteu atrocidades, é certo; mas, se ao lermos a descripção de suas inclemencias e durezas, nos lembrarmos das circumstancias em que foram praticadas, veremos que muitas, se não todas, dictou-as a necessidade de manter a disciplina, ou de domar a aspereza dos inimigos.
<p>Tendo Vasco da Gama acceitado a espinhosa commissão, aperceberam-se os tres navios construidos expressamente para ella: ‘S. Gabriel’, ‘S. Rafael’ e ‘S. Miguel’. No primeiro arvorou Vasco da Gama o pendão de commandante; ao segundo deu por capitão seu irmão Paulo da Gama; e o terceiro, conhecido pela alcunha de ‘Berrio’, ficou sob as ordens de Nicolau Coelho.
<p>Nada faltava á expedição. Abundancia de mantimentos, boa artilheria, velame de sobreselente, medico, botica, presentes para os reis em cujos dominios aportasse, tudo se preparou. A armada partio do Tejo a 8 de julho de 1497 por entre as saudações e as lagrimas da numerosa multidão, que affluira á praia do Restello.
<p>Depois de avistar as Canarias, e de fazer aguada na ilha de Santa Maria, archipelago de Cabo Verde, seguio Vasco da Gama para o cabo da Boa Esperança… Começaram os trabalhos e os perigos. Desencadeavam-se furiosas as tempestades ameaçando submergir a armada inteira, e a esta lucta incessante com os elementos juntava-se a insubordinação dos tripulantes, que não queriam continuar a viagem. Serenadas as tormentas e suffocada a insurreição, chegou a frota no dia 8 de novembro á bahia que tem por nome ‘Angra de Santa Helena’.
<p>Saídos em terra os portuguezes para fazer observações, descobriram dois negros atrás de uma collina. Deram-lhes de comer, e prometteram manjares e contas de cristal a todos os companheiros, que descessem á praia. Os negros accederam ao convite, mostraram-se amigos dos nossos; mas pouco depois revelaram-se traiçoeiros e malfeitores. Em vista da hospedagem que os indigenas lhe offereciam, decidio Vasco da Gama fazer-se novamente de véla, e a 20 de novembro conseguio dobrar o cabo da Boa Esperança. Removeram-se os terrores, com que o afamado promontorio salteava a imaginação dos tripulantes, e começou a empreza a affigurar-se mais auspiciosa.
<p>A sessenta leguas de distancia a armada surgio e fundeou em uma bahia chamada ‘Aguada’ ou ‘Angra de S. Braz’. E como os portuguezes temessem um recebimento igual ao que tiveram na ‘Angra de Santa Helena’, desembarcaram promptos e armados para a lucta. Tiveram com effeito de repellir a violenta aggressão de um enorme bando de negros hottentotes. Estes indigenas são de estatura meã, espadaúdos, e as mulheres têem uma bossa no prolongamento dos rins, que produz um effeito desusado, e que lhes serve para trazer os filhos. Cumpre todavia dizer que esta bossa é ainda mais accentuada nas mulheres ‘bochimans’.
<p>Quando deixaram a ‘Aguada de S. Braz’ padeceram os portugueses uma furiosa tempestade, que os fez quasi desesperar de salvamento; mas, conjurado o perigo, avistaram a 26 de dezembro os ilhéus Chãos, a 27 o ilhéu da Cruz, e chegaram no dia 28 á altura do rio do Infante, ultimo ponto a que chegara Bartholomeu Dias.
<p>Forçado Vasco da Gama a entrar em algum porto onde se abastecesse de agua, aproximou-se da costa, e no dia 10 de janeiro de 1498 descobrio um pequeno rio. Como visse em terra muitos negros de elevada estatura e grande corpulencia, mandou desembarcar o lingua Martim Affonso com alguns brindes para o senhor d’aquelles negros, a fim de colher informações a respeito da India. Estavam os nossos no paiz da Cafraria, cujo chefe, deslumbrado pela formosura dos presentes e pelo incarnado da carapuça com que Vasco da Gama o brindara, recebeu amavelmente a Martim Affonso e ao companheiro, deu-lhes papas de milho e uma gallinha, e enviou ao commandante alguns refrescos.
<p>A tribo da Cafraria que Vasco da Gama visitou, foi a dos zulus. São homens bravos, energicos, intelligentes, de pelle não preta, mas bronzeada. Pertencem á raça designada pelo nome de ‘negroide’. O nauta portuguez chamou á paragem, em que viviam estes cafres, ‘Aguada’ ou ‘Terra da Boa Paz’, e ao rio em que se proveu de agua, ‘Rio do Cobre’.
<p>Proseguindo na derrota, descobrio a 26 de janeiro um outro rio de larga embocadura, no qual vogavam alguns bateis tripulados por homens que pareciam mestiços de ethiopes e arabes. Eram em extremo communicativos, subiam ás naus, recebiam presentes, davam em troca os productos da sua terra, e um d’elles dizia ser de muito longe, e affirmava ter já visto navios do tamanho dos nossos. Contente com taes auspicios, Vasco da Gama baptisou o rio com o nome dos ‘Bons Signaes’, e erigio n’elle um padrão que vinha a bordo do ‘S. Rafael’, e que d’este nome tambem foi appellidado. A alegria porém foi pouco duradoura, porque tendo o commandante resolvido permanecer algum tempo n’aquelle rio, eis que a tripulação adoece ao cabo de poucos dias atacada de escorbuto. O rio era o Zambeze, cujas margens insalubres iam servindo de sepultura áquelle punhado de heroes.</p>

În apropierea casei noastre se afla un magazin cu mașini de cusut unde mă duceam în fiecare zi și stăteam ore întregi.

Trăiau împreună undeva într-o mahala și ziua se ocupau de prăvălie; n-aveau nici cunoștințe, nici rude.
<p>Prăvălia era o simplă odaie particulară închiriată întâia oară pentru comerț. Pereții mai păstrau încă zugrăveala lor de salon, cu ghirlănzi violete de liliac și urmele rectangulare și decolorate ale locurilor unde fuseseră atârnate tablourile, în mijlocul plafonului rămăsese o lampă de bronz cu o calotă de majolică de culoare roșie închisă, acoperită pe margine cu foi verzi de acantă reliefate din faianță. Era un obiect plin de ornamente, vechi și desuet însă impozant – ceva ce semăna cu un monument funerar ori cu un general veteran purtând la paradă bătrâna lui uniformă.
<p>Mașinile de cusut se înșirau bine aliniate pe trei rânduri, lăsând între ele două alei largi până în fund. Eugen avea grijă să stropească podeaua fiecare dimineață cu o cutie veche de conserve găurită în fund. Șuvița de apă care se scurgea era foarte subțire și Eugen o mânuia cu dexteritate desenând pe podea spirale și opturi savante. Câteodată se iscălea și scria data zilei. Zugrăveala de pe pereți reclama în mod evident asemenea delicateți.
<p>În fundul magazinului un paravan de scânduri despărțea un fel de cabină de restul încăperii; o perdea verde acoperea intrarea. Acolo stăteau tot timpul Eugen și Clara, acolo mâncau la prânz, pentru ca să nu părăsească prăvălia în timpul zilei. Ei o numeau „cabina artiștilor” și îl auzii pe Eugen într-o zi spunând:
<p>—E o adevărată „cabină de artist”. Când ies în prăvălie și vorbesc jumătate de ceas pentru ca să vând o mașină de cusut, nu joc o comedie?
<p>Și adăugă pe un ton mai doct:
<p>—Viața, în general e teatru curat.
<p>În dosul cortinei Eugen cânta din vioară. Ținea notele pe masă, stătea îngheboșat asupra lor descifrând cu răbdare portativele încâlcite ca și cum ar fi descurcat un ghem de ațe cu multe noduri pentru a scoate din ele un fir unic și subțire, firul bucății muzicale. Toată după-amiaza ardea pe un cufăr o lampă mică de petrol umplând încăperea cu o lumii moartă și deorganizând pe perete umbra enormă a violonistului.
<p>Veneam atât de des acolo încât cu timpul devenii un fel de oaspete mobilă, o prelungire a canapelei vechi de mușama pe care stăteam imobil, un lucru de care nu se ocupa nimeni și nu stânjenea pe nimeni.
În fundul cabinei Clara își făcea toaleta de după-masă. Își ținea rochiile într-un dulăpior și se privea într-o oglindă spartă răzimată de lampă, pe cufăr. Era o oglindă atât de veche încât toată poleiala era ștearsă pe alocuri și prin petele transparente apăreau obiectele reale din dosul oglinzii amestecându-se cu imaginile reflectate, ca într-o fotografie cu clișee suprapuse.
<p>Câteodată se dezbrăca aproape de tot și se fricționa cu apă de Colonie pe la subțiori, ridicând fără jenă brațele, ori pe sâni – băgând mâna între cămașă și corp. Cămașa era scurtă și când se apleca vedeam în întregime picioarele foarte frumoase strânse de ciorapii bine întinși. Semăna în tot cu o femeie pe jumătate goală, pe care o văzusem cândva pe o carte poștală pornografică ce mi-o arătase un covrigar la grădină.
<p>Provoca în mine același leșin nedeslușit ca și imaginea obscenă, un fel de vid ce se făcea în piept în același timp cu o poftă sexuală îngrozitoare ce-mi strângea pubisul ca niște gheare.
<p>Stăteam în „cabină” întotdeauna în același loc, pe canapea în dosul lui Eugen, și așteptam ca să-și termine Clara toaleta. Atunci ea ieșea în magazin, trecând între mine și fratele ei printr-un spațiu atât de strâmt încât trebuia să-și frece pulpele de genunchii mei.
<p>Clipa aceasta o așteptam în fiecare zi cu aceeași nerăbdare și același chin. Ea depindea de o mulțime de circumstanțe mărunte pe care le cântăream și le pândeam cu o exasperată și extraordinar de ascuțită sensibilitate. Era de ajuns ca lui Eugen să-i fie sete, să n-aibă poftă de cântat ori să vie un client în prăvălie pentru ca să părăsească locul de lângă masă și spațiul să rămâie destul de liber pentru ca să poată trece Clara departe de mine.
<p>Când după-amiaza mergeam acolo și mă apropiam de ușa magazinului, antene lungi și vibrante ieșeau din mine și explorau aerul pentru a capta sunetul viorii; dacă auzeam că Eugen cântă se făcea în mine o mare liniște. Intram cât mai încet și spuneam chiar din prag cu voce tare numele meu pentru ca el să nu creadă că a venit un client și astfel să întrerupă cântatul o secundă; s-ar fi putut întâmpla ca în secunda aceea să înceteze brusc inerția și mirajul melodiei și Eugen să părăsească vioara și să nu mai cânte deloc în după-amiaza aceea.
<p>Cu asta însă nu se sfârșea posibilitatea întâmplărilor nefavorabile. Erau încă atâtea lucruri ce se petreceau în cabină… Tot timpul cât Clara își făcea toaleta ascultam cele mai mici zgomote și urmăream cele mai mici mișcări cu teama ca nu cumva din ele să iasă dezastrul după-amiezii.
<p>Era posibil de pildă ca Eugen să tușească ușor, să înghită puțină salivă și să spuie brusc că îi este sete și că merge la cofetărie să ia o prăjitură; din fapte infim de mărunte, ca tusea aceasta, ieșea monstruoasă și enormă o după-masă pierdută. Ziua întreagă își pierdea atunci importanța și noaptea în pat, în loc să mă gândesc pe îndelete (și oprindu-mă câteva minute asupra fiecărui detaliu pentru a-l „vedea” și a mi-l aminti mai bine) la clipa când genunchii mei s-au atins de ciorapii Clarei – să scobesc, să sculptez și să mângâi acest gând – mă zvârcoleam înfierbântat în cearceafuri, neputând să adorm și așteptând nerăbdător ziua următoare.
<p>Într-o zi se petrecu ceva cu totul neobișnuit. Întâmplarea începu cu alura unui dezastru și se isprăvi cu o surpriză neașteptată, dar în mod atât de brusc și cu un gest atât de mărunt încât toată bucuria mea ulterioară odihnindu-se pe el fu ca un eșafodaj de obiecte eteroclite ținute în echilibru de un scamator pe un singur punct.
Clara cu un singur pas schimbă în întregime conținutul vizitelor mele, dându-le un alt înțeles și noi înfrigurări ca în experiența aceea de chimie în care vedeam cum o singură bucățică de cristal scufundată într-un bocal cu lichid roșu îl transforma instantaneu într-un lichid uimitor de verde.
<p>Eram pe canapea, în același loc, așteptând cu aceeași nerăbdare de totdeauna, când ușa se deschise și în prăvălie intră cineva. Eugen părăsi imediat cabina. Totul părea pierdut. Clara continuă să-și facă toaleta nepăsătoare în timp ce conversația în prăvălie se prelungea la nesfârșit. Totuși s-ar fi putut întâmpla ca Eugen să se întoarcă înainte ca sora lui să fi isprăvit să se îmbrace.
<p>Urmăream dureros firul celor două evenimente, toaleta Clarei și conversația din prăvălie, gândindu-mă că puteau să-și urmez desfășurarea paralel unul cu altul până ce Clara ieșea în prăvălie, ori din contra să se întâlnească în punctul fix al cabinei ca în unele filme cinematografice când două locomotive vin una spre alta cu viteză nebun și se vor întâlni ori vor trece pe alături după cum va interveni sau nu în ultima clipă o mână misterioasă care să schimbe macazul. În acele momente de așteptare simțeam net cum conversația își urmează drumul ei și, pe o cale paralelă, Clara continua să se pudreze…
Încercai să corectez fatalitatea întinzând genunchii mult spre masă. Pentru ca să întâlnească picioarele Clarei ar fi trebuit să stau chiar pe marginea canapelei într-o poziție dacă nu bizară, cel puțin comică. Îmi pare că prin oglindă Clara se uita la mine și zâmbea.
<p>În curând isprăvi să-și rotunjească conturul buzelor cu carmin și să-și treacă pentru ultima oară puful pe obraz. Parfumul care se răspândise în cabină mă amețise de pofte și disperare. În momentul când ea trecu pe lângă mine se întâmplă lucrul la care mă așteptam mai puțin: își frecă pulpele de genunchii mei ca în fiecare zi (ori poate încă mai tare? dar asta era o iluzie desigur) cu aerul indiferent că între noi nu se petrece nimic.
<p>Există o complicitate a viciului mai adâncă și mai rapidă decât orice înțelegere prin cuvinte. Ea străbate instantaneu tot trupul ca o melodie interioară și transformă cu totul gândurile, carnea și sângele. În fragmentul de secundă când picioarele Clarei mă atinseseră se născură, imense, în mine, noi așteptări și noi speranțe.
<p>Cu Clara am înțeles totul din prima zi, din prima clipă; a fost întâia mea aventură sexuală completă și normală. O aventură plină de chinuri și așteptări, plină de neliniști și de scrâșnete de dinți, ceva care ar fi semănat cu o iubire dacă n-ar fi fost o simplă continuitate a unei dureroase nerăbdări. În aceeași măsură în care eram impulsiv și îndrăzneț, Clara era calmă și capricioasă; avea un mod violent de a mă provoca și un fel de bucurie câinească de a mă vedea că sufăr – bucurie care preceda întotdeauna actul sexual și făcea parte dintr-însul.
<p>Întâia oară când se întâmplă între noi lucrul pe care îl așteptam de atâta vreme, provocarea ei fu de o simplicitate atât de elementară (și aproape brutală) încât fraza aceea săracă pe care a pronunțat-o atunci și verbul acela anonim pe care l-a întrebuințat își păstrează încă și azi în mine ceva din virulența de-odinioară. Este de ajuns ca să mă gândesc mai mult la ele pentru ca indiferența mea prezentă să fie roasă ca de un acid și fraza să redevie violentă, așa cum a fost atunci.
<p>Eugen plecase în oraș. Stăteam amândoi în magazin tăcuți, Clara, îi rochia ei de după-masă, picior peste picior în dosul vitrinei, tricota cu atenție. Trecuseră câteva săptămâni de la întâmplarea din cabină și între noi se crease brusc nu știu ce răceală severă, o încordare secretă ce se traducea printr-o indiferență extremă din partea ei. Stăteam unul în fața altuia ore întregi fără să scoatem un cuvânt și totuși în tăcerea aceasta plutea ca amenințarea unei explozii, o înțelegere secretă perfectă, îmi lipsea doar cuvântul misterios care să spargă învelișul convențional; îmi făceam zeci de proiecte în fiecare seară dar ele se loveau a doua zi de cele mai elementare piedici: tricotatul care nu putea fi întrerupt, lipsa unei lumini mai favorabile, liniștea din magazin ori cele trei rânduri de mașini de cusut, prea corect orânduite pentru a permite vreo schimbare importantă în magazin, fie chiar de ordin sentimental.
<p>Țineam tot timpul maxilarele încleștate; era o tăcere teribilă, o tăcere ce avea în mine evidența și conturul unui urlet.
<p>Clara fu acea care o întrerupse. Vorbi aproape în șoaptă, fără să-și ridice ochii de pe tricou:
<p>—Dacă ai fi venit azi mai devreme am fi putut să facem, Eugen s-a dus îndată după masă în oraș.
<p>Până atunci nu se filtrase în tăcerea noastră nici umbra vreunei aluzii sexuale și iată acum din câteva cuvinte țâșnea între noi o realitate nouă, atât de miraculoasă și de extraordinară ca o statuie de marmoră ce-ar fi răsărit în mijlocul mașinilor de cusut crescând din podele.
<p>Într-o clipă fui lângă Clara, îi apucai o mână și i-o mângâiai violent, îi sărutai mâna. Ea și-o smulse.
<p>—Ei, lasă-mă, spuse ea enervată.
<p>—Te rog vino, Clara…
<p>—E prea târziu acum, se întoarce Eugen, lasă-mă, lasă-mă.
<p>Îi atingeam febril umerii, sânii, picioarele.
<p>—Lasă-mă, protesta Clara.
<p>—Vino acum, mai avem timp, implorai eu.
<p>—Unde?
<p>—În cabină… hai… acolo e bine.
<p>Și când spusei „bine” pieptul mi se umplu de o speranță caldă, îi sărutai din nou mâna și o trăsei cu forța de pe scaun. Ea se lăsă dusă cu greu târându-și pașii de podea.
<p>Începând din ziua aceea după-amiezile își schimbară „obiceiurile”: era vorba tot despre Eugen, tot despre Clara și despre aceleași sonate, însă acum cântecul viorii îmi deveni insuportabil și nerăbdarea mea pândea momentul când Eugen trebuia să plece. În aceeași cabină neliniștile mele deveniră altele ca și cum aș fi jucat un joc nou pe un carton cu linii desenate pentru un joc deja cunoscut.
<p>Când Eugen pleca, începea adevărata așteptare. Era o așteptare mai grea și mai insuportabilă decât până în acel moment; tăcerea prăvăliei se transforma într-un bloc de gheață. Clara se așeza la vitrină și tricota: acesta era în fiecare zi „începutul” și fără început aventura noastră nu putea avea loc. Câteodată Eugen pleca și o lăsa pe Clara în cabină aproape dezbrăcată: credeam că lucrul acesta putea să grăbească evenimentele dar mă înșelam, Clara nu admitea alt început decât acel din prăvălie. Trebuia să aștept în mod inutil să se îmbrace și să iasă la geam pentru a deschide cartea după-amiezii la prima pagină, în dosul vitrinei.
<p>Mă așezam în fața ei pe un scăunel și începeam să-i vorbesc, s-o rog, s-o implor timp îndelungat. Știam că e fără folos; Clara nu accepta decât rareori și chiar atunci uza de o șiretenie, pentru ca să nu-mi acorde îngăduință perfectă:
—Mă duc să iau un praf în cabină, mă doare capul îngrozitor, te rog să nu vii după mine.
Promiteam cu jurăminte și o urmam într-o secundă, începea în cabină o veritabilă luptă în care, în mod evident, forțele Clarei erau dispuse să cedeze. Cădea atunci pe canapea dintr-o bucată ca și cum s-ar fi împiedecat de ceva. Punea apoi mâinile sub cap și închidea ochii ca și cum ar fi dormit, îmi era imposibil să schimb cu un centimetru poziția corpului; așa cum stătea pe o coastă, trebuia să-i smulg rochia de sub pulpe și să mă alipesc de ea. Clara n-avea nici o opunere pentru gesturile mele, dar nu-mi dădea nici o înlesnire. Era imobilă și indiferentă ca o bucată de lemn și numai intima și secreta ei căldură îmi revela că e atentă și că „știe”.
<p>Cam pe la această epocă fu consultat medicul care îmi prescrise chinină. Verificarea impresiei mele că avea ceva șoricesc într-însul a avut loc în cabină și, după cum am spus, într-un mod cu totul absurd surprinzător.
<p>Într-o zi, în timp ce stăteam lipit de Clara și cu gesturi înfierbânte îi smulgeam rochia, simții ceva ciudat mișcându-se în cabină și – mai mult cu instinctul obscur dar foarte ascuțit al extremei plăceri de care mă apropiam și care nu admitea nici o prezență străină, decât cu simțurile mele adevărate – ghicii că o ființă vie ne privea.
<p>Întorsei capul speriat și zării pe cufăr în dosul cutiei de pudră un șoarece. El se opri chiar lângă oglindă pe marginea cufărului și mă privii fix cu ochii lui mici și negri în care lumina lămpii punea două picături lucioase aurii ce mă săgetau adânc. Timp de câteva secunde el se uită în ochii mei cu atâta acuitate încât simțeam privirea celor două puncte sticloase pătrunzându-mi până în fundul creierului. Părea că meditează o invectivă grea la adresa mea sau numai un reproș. Deodată însă fascinația se sfărâmă și șoarecele o rupse de fugă dispărând după cufăr. Eram sigur acum că doctorul venise să mă spioneze.
<p>În aceeași seară, la luarea chininei, presupunerea mea se întări printr-un raționament perfect ilogic, însă pentru mine valabil: chinina era amară; pe de altă parte doctorul văzuse în cabină plăcerea pe care mi-o dădea câteodată Clara; în consecință, și pentru stabilirea unui nou echilibru, îmi prescrisese medicamentul cel mai neplăcut ce putea să existe. Îl auzeam ronțăindu-și în gând judecata: „Cu cât este mai mare plăcerrrea, cu atât trebuie să fie mai amarrrră doctorria!”
Peste câteva luni de la consultație doctorul fu găsit mort în podul casei lui; își trăsese un glonte în tâmplă.
Cea dintâi întrebare a mea când auzii sinistra veste fu:
<p>—Erau șoareci în podul acela?
<p>Îmi era necesară această certitudine. Pentru ca doctorul să fie mort cu adevărat, trebuia neapărat ca o haită de șoareci să năvălească asupra cadavrului, să-l scobească și să extragă înapoi materia șoricească împrumutată de medic în timpul vieții sale, pentru exercitarea existenței sale ilegale de „om”.

<h1>German</h1>
<p><em>Hermann Heiberg „Todsünden“</em><br>
Unter den großen Verdiensten, die der Träger dieses vielgefeierten Namens sich erworben, steht nicht in letzter Linie das: in jenen drangvollen Zeiten, als eine kraftvolle Gegenwartskunst mit einer schwächlichen Nachklangskunst zusammenprallte, der neuen Dichtung in den weiteren Kreisen des bis dahin gleichgültig gebliebenen Publikums Bahn gebrochen zu haben.<p>
Es geschah dies durch seine Bücher „Plaudereien mit der Herzogin von Seeland“ und „Apotheker Heinrich.“<p>
Aber wie, Heiberg ein Bahnbrecher? Er war allerdings sehr viel weniger ein solcher, als die, welche das Wort Realismus auf ihre Fahne geschrieben hatten. Er—so wenig wie Theodor Fontane—brach auch keineswegs so ganz mit der Vergangenheit, wie jene es zu thun meinten; er—so wenig wie Theodor Fontane—stellte keine großartigen, langatmigen und langweiligen Programme auf; er—so wenig wie Theodor Fontane—spielte sich als Begründer einer ganz neuen, noch nie dagewesenen Poesie auf. Dafür vollbrachten Theodor Fontane und Hermann Heiberg realistische Thaten; sie waren unter den ersten in Deutschland, welche die Wirklichkeitskunst begründeten. In den siebziger Jahren erschien ganz im Stillen Fontanes „L’Adultera“; Heiberg schrieb 81 seine graziösen, entzückenden Plaudereien und zwar nur, „um seine mißmutigen Gedanken zu töten,“ keineswegs aber, am allerwenigsten, um Belegstücke zu liefern, welche die einzige Berechtigung des neuen Dogmas darthun sollten.<p>
Er schrieb sie freilich gerade in der Zeit, als jener heiße Kampf entbrannte; doch hat das vielleicht nicht so sehr den maß- und geschmackvollen Realismus, der seine Dichtungen kennzeichnet, hervorgerufen, als sein durch seine Vergangenheit geschärfter Wirklichkeitssinn. Er »war« Realist, er wurd’ es nicht erst. Denn er hatte gelebt, und er hatte erlebt, eh’ er die Feder ergriff; er war ein reifer Mann, als er sein erstes Buch schrieb; er erfüllte buchstäblich die Forderung der Concourts, (wenn ich nicht irre, waren es die beiden Brüder, welche sie aufstellten,) daß man erst vierzig Jahre zählen müsse, bevor man sich Realist nennen dürfe. Aber Realist! Meines Wissens hat sich Heiberg nie so genannt, und da seine Bücher nicht „die einzige Berechtigung des Realismus“ beweisen wollten, da er sich nicht auf ein einseitiges Dogmenverkünden und Dogmenbeweisen kapriziert hatte, sondern in Wahrheit nichts anderes als wirken, nämlich die Sinne und die Seele des Lesers nach seinem Willen regieren, sie mit den Bildern und Vorstellungen, welche seine Ideen forderten, füllen wollte—etwas, was bis jetzt alle Dichter seit Homer, ohne Ausnahme, erstrebten —, so nahte seinen Büchern das Publikum sich unbefangen und ohne jegliche Voreingenommenheit. Dem Publikum ist es nämlich in der That ja ganz gleichgültig, wer vor ihm steht, ob es ein Idealist, Romantiker, Realist oder was immer sei—als ob überhaupt die Wirklichkeit diese Gegensätze so scharf begrenzt anseinanderhielte!—es will nur eins: es will bezwungen sein; der Leser wünscht zu fühlen, daß der Künstler Gewalt über ihn habe, er will sein Gefangener sein…
Heiberg bezwang das Publikum; er fesselte es mit Rosenguirlanden in seinen entzückenden Plaudereien; aber aus seinen folgenden Büchern—ich denke hier besonders an den „Apotheker Heinrich“—langte es mitunter zugleich wie ein Paar grauer Schattenarme, die sich Einem unvermerkt um den Hals schlangen, fester und fester… und die uns mit unheimlicher Gewalt tiefer und tiefer in das Buch und seine Geschichten hineinzusehen zwangen, bis langsam sich die Spannung löste und ein hinreißender Humor uns den Alp von der tiefaufatmenden Brust wälzte… Was sag’ ich? in das Buch? In das Leben, in das Leben, wie es ist! In allen seinen folgenden Arbeiten, wenn auch in einzelnen bisweilen die Kraft des Dichters nachzulassen schien, steckte ein Element der Ursprünglichkeit, ein naives, leidenschaftliches Ergreifen der Dinge, wie es Einem lange nicht vorgekommen. Und dabei doch wieder: man fühlte sich so wohl bei Heiberg; er hat etwas Aristokratisches, Vornehmes, Weltmännisches; bei ihm vereinigte sich Weltton mit Frische, heitere Laune mit einer schneidenden Satire. Auch seine berückendsten Schilderungen waren durch einen goldechten Humor verklärt. Dieser Humor gerade ist das Auszeichnende der schriftstellerischen Persönlichkeit Heibergs: nicht viele Dichter der gegenwärtigen Zeit können sich zu diesem Erlösungsmittel durchringen, sie werden immer zwischen den schmerzvollsten Gegensätzen hin und her geschleudert, und erleichtert seufzen sie auf, wenn ihnen ein Begünstigter begegnet, und horchen auf ihn, um zu lernen, wie man das schwere Leben leicht nimmt.<p>
Und dringender wurde nun allgemach das Fragen: Wer ist dieser Mann? Wo kommt er her? Nicht müßige Neugierde blos war es, die so forschte. Denn, um es mit einem groben und beschränkten Wort zu sagen: Was Einer ißt, das ist er. Meine Leser verstehen sicher, was ich meine.<p><br>

<em>Man erfuhr nach und nach folgendes</em><br>
Hermann Heiberg ist am 17. November 1840 in Schleswig, der jetzigen Provinzialhauptstadt, als Sohn eines Rechtsanwalts geboren. Die Heibergs, eine angesehene Patrizierfamilie, spielten in der kleinen Stadt seit langem eine große Rolle. Heibergs Mutter, die noch lebt, entstammt dem gräflichen Hause Baudissin-Knoop. Er verlebte eine sehr glückliche Jugend, man ließ ihm als Knaben Luft und Licht … und er war ein frischer, fröhlicher Junge, kein Stuben- und Ofenhocker. Seine Jugend wirft denn auch einen lichten, lachenden Schein in all seine Bücher,… er ist einer der größten und naturwahrsten Kinderdarsteller der Gegenwart, ebenso wie er die Kleinstadt, in der eben seine Jugend dahinfloß, meisterhaft zu vergegenwärtigen weiß. Nachdem Heiberg das Gymnasium seiner Vaterstadt durchlaufen hatte, wollte er das Studium der Rechte ergreifen; doch verhinderten die damaligen Wirrnisse in Schleswig-Holstein und andere Umstände die Ausführung dieses Entschlusses. Heiberg ward Kaufmann und zwar Buchhändler. Seine Lehrjahre, die er später im „Januskopf“, diesem vortrefflichen Buchhändlerroman, geschildert hat, absolvierte er in Kiel. Dann übernahm er in Schleswig die selbständige Leitung einer von seinem Vater begründeten, aber bisher von fremder Hand verwalteten Buchhandlung, die er wenige Jahre später, nachdem er inzwischen ein Jahr in Köln gewesen, als Eigentum an sich brachte. Nach dem Krieg von 1866 verkaufte er sein aufblühendes und mit einer eigenen Druckerei versehenes Geschäft, um nach Berlin zu übersiedeln. Hier ward er vorerst geschäftlicher Leiter der Nordd. Allg. Ztg., dann der Spenerschen Zeitung, doch bald wurde der energische und tüchtige Mann in die Direktion der Preußischen Bankanstalt berufen. In seiner neuen Stellung sammelte er die vielseitigsten Erfahrungen, zumal sie ihn zu häufigen und ausgedehnten Reisen durch Deutschland, die Schweiz, Holland, Belgien, Dänemark, Frankreich und England veranlaßte. Wo ist ein Schriftsteller mit einer so eigentümlichen und bewegten Vergangenheit, ein Schriftsteller, der als thätiger Mann im Leben stand, nicht es als müßiger Zuschauer beobachtete?… Die Bank liquidierte; er stellte sich auf eigne Füße und beschäftigte sich vorwiegend mit der Einleitung zur Finanzierung von Eisenbahn- und Tramway-Unternehmungen; erhielt auch einige male allein oder im Verein mit anderen bedeutsame Vertretungen—so war er z.B. einmal vorübergehend Bevollmächtigter der chinesischen Regierung für eine Finanzierung in London —, zog sich aber endlich doch, mehrfach um die Früchte seines Fleißes und seiner Geschicklichkeit gebracht und grenzenlos angewidert von allem, was „Geschäft“ heißt, zurück. Im Jahre 1881 schrieb er dann, „um meine mißmutigen Gedanken zu töten,“ wie er sagt, jene reizenden „Plaudereien mit der Herzogin von Seeland.“ Der große Erfolg, den dieses anmutige und originelle Buch fand, ermunterte ihn zum Weiterschaffen, und so lebt er denn noch jetzt als Schriftsteller in Berlin W., an der Seite einer liebenswürdigen Frau, mit der er sich 1865 vermählt hat, umgeben von einem blühenden Kinderkreis, rastlos und erfolgreich thätig.<p>
Hiermit legt der Verein der Bücherfreunde der deutschen Leserwelt sein neuestes Werk vor.</p>

<h1>English</h1>
<span class="dlig"><p><em>Francis Henry Gribble “Lausanne”</em><br>
Though Lausanne is so near Geneva, its history, in historical times, has been widely different from that of the neighbouring town. Geneva enjoyed a modified independence from an early date, and became completely independent early in the sixteenth century. Lausanne, until nearly 300 years later, endured the domination, first of Savoy, and subsequently of Berne. <span class="red">❡</span> The early history is obscure and full of vexed questions as well as unfamiliar names; but the central fact is that the Counts of Savoy—they were not promoted to be Dukes of Savoy until later—took possession of the Canton of Vaud, as well as of the Chablais and the lower Valais, after the death of the last of the Zaeringen, at the beginning of the thirteenth century. For the next 300 years they exercised overlordship, limited by the charters of the towns, and, in the case of Lausanne, by the jurisdiction of the Bishop—a complicated state of things which the Swiss historical societies may be left to unravel. <span class="red">❡</span> It seems clear, however, that the Savoyards were no hard taskmasters. ‘The country of Vaud,’ says its historian, Louis Vulliemin, ‘was happy and proud to belong to them. They exacted little from it, and accorded it their powerful protection. The various States used to assemble at Moudon, the central town, summoned by the Council of Moudon, or by the Governor of Vaud, acting as the representative of the Prince. There was no palace. They met in an inn, or in the house of one of the citizens of the neighbourhood. Often they assembled in such small numbers that, for lack of a quorum, no decision could be taken… No burdensome or unduly progressive measures were adopted. As a rule, the good old customs were confirmed. When a departure from them was resolved upon, it became law by receiving the sanction of the Prince. The business of the herald was to see that it was proclaimed, in the proper places, in a loud and intelligible voice. The Prince had sworn an oath to impose no new legislation that was not in accordance with the will of the nation as expressed by the estates of the realm.’ <span class="red">❡</span> The most notable of the Governors was Peter of Savoy—the same Peter of Savoy whom we meet in English history, fighting in the civil wars of the days of Simon de Montfort. His headquarters were in the Castle of Chillon, where he not only dispensed justice, but also amended the criminal law. It was the barbarous rule of the time that an offender who had been fined for a misdemeanour should have his nose cut off if he were unable to pay; Peter compelled even the Bishops to abandon that cruel custom. For the rest, to quote Vulliemin: ‘He received his vassals in the great hall of the Castle, where their coats of arms hung on the wall around that of the House of Savoy. The blowing of a horn announced that the meal was served. The ladies arrived in their emblazoned best. The chaplain read the grace from a volume bound in violet and gold—the precious depositary of Divine law and ecclesiastical ritual. After the feast came the hour of merry recreations. The Court fool and the minstrels took their seats by the side of the Prince, and the nobility thus passed their lives in junketing.’<br><br>
<em>This is the same writer’s picture of the lives of the burghers:</em><br>
‘At Lausanne the three estates met in the month of May. In 1398 they submitted to a fresh drafting of the “Plaid général,” which defined the respective rights of bishop, canons, and burghers. Three days were devoted to the hearing of suits. On the fourth day the Plaid, accompanied by elders, went the round of the streets, and ordered the necessary repairs. All the citizens were required to follow, carrying axes or stakes, so as to be able to lend a hand when required. The Bishop regaled the artificers with bread, wine, and eggs. In return, the blacksmiths had to shoe his horses, the saddlers to provide him with spurs and bridles, and the coachbuilders to supply him with a carriage. Three times a year the Seneschal passed in front of the cobblers’ shops, and touched with his rod the pair of boots which he selected for his lordship. In time of war the prelate’s army had to serve the Prince for a day and a night without pay, and as much longer as they might be wanted for wages. The Bishop’s business was to ransom prisoners, protect the citizens from all injustice, and go to war on their behalf if necessary.</p>
<p>‘Each district of the town had its special privileges. The fine for assault and battery was sixty livres in the city where the Bishop resided, sixty sous in the lower town, and only three sous outside the walls. The Bishop could not arrest a citizen without informing the burghers, or hold an inquest on the body of a dead man. The citizens of the Rue de la Bourg sat in judgment on criminals without assessors. Whenever they heard the summons, though they might be at the dinner-table, glass in hand, or in their shops measuring their cloth, they had to run off and give their opinion on the case. In return, they were exempt from certain taxes, had the sole right of placing hucksters’ barrows in front of their shops, of using signboards, and of keeping inns.’</p>
<p>It was the Reformation that terminated this primitive state of affairs. A succession of weak Governors had allowed the hold of the Dukes of Savoy over the country to be relaxed. It was impossible for them to maintain their authority when the people were indoctrinated with the new ideas. The end came when the Duke of Savoy threatened Geneva, and the Bernese marched through Vaud to the rescue, captured Chillon, delivered Bonivard, and kept the Canton for their reward.</p>
<p>From the capture of Chillon onwards, Lausanne, like the rest of Vaud, was a Bernese dependency. Bernese governors (or baillis) were established in all the strong places, and Protestantism became the national religion.</p>
<p>The conversion of the inhabitants was chiefly effected by Viret, a tailor’s son, from Orbe, an excellent man, and a persuasive rather than an eloquent speaker. In 1536, after the fashion of the times, he, Calvin, and Farel challenged the Catholic theologians to a great debate. The monks, recognizing him as a formidable antagonist, had previously tried to get rid of him by surreptitious means. One of them had assaulted him at Payerne, and another had attempted to poison him at Geneva. At Lausanne they were obliged to argue with him, and failed still more conspicuously. The argument lasted for a week, and, at the end of the week, the populace, considering that the Protestant case was proved, proceeded to the cathedral to desecrate the altars and smash the images, while the governors confiscated the Church property and offered it for sale. ‘It was thus,’ writes Vulliemin, ‘that Jost de Diesbach bought the church and vicarage of St. Christophe in order to turn the one into a baking house and the other into a country seat, and that Michel Augsburger transformed the ancient church of Baulmes into a stable for his cattle.’</p>

<h1>In CONGRESS, July 4, 1776.</h1><br>
<br>
<em>A DECLARATION<br>
By the REPRESENTATIVES of the<br>
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,<br>
In GENERAL CONGRESS assembled.</em><br><br>
<p>WHEN in the Courſe of human Events, it becomes neceſſary for one People to diſſolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to aſſume among the Powers of the Earth, the ſeparate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature’s God entitle them, a decent Reſpect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they ſhould declare the cauſes which impel them to the Separation.
<p>We hold theſe Truths to be ſelf-evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among theſe are Life, Liberty and the Purſuit of happineſs— That to ſecure theſe Rights, Governments are inſtituted among Men, deriving their juſt Powers from the Conſent of the Governed. That whenever any Form of Government becomes deſtructive of theſe Ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to aboliſh it, and to inſtitute new Government, laying its Foundation on ſuch Principles and organizing its Powers in ſuch Form, as to them ſhall ſeem moſt likely to effect their Safety and Happineſs. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long eſtabliſhed ſhould not be changed for light and tranſient Cauſes; and accordingly all Experience hath ſhown that Mankind are more diſpoſed to ſuffer, while Evils are ſufferable, than to right themſelves by aboliſhing the Forms to which they are accuſtomed. But when a long Train of Abuſes and Uſurpations, purſuing invariably the ſame Object, evinces a Deſign to reduce them under abſolute Deſpotiſm, it is their Right, it is their Duty, to throw off ſuch Government, and to provide new Guards for their future Security. Such has been the patient Sufferance of theſe Colonies; and ſuch is now the Neceſſity which conſtrains them to alter their former Syſtems of Government. The Hiſtory of the preſent King of Great-Britain is a Hiſtory of repeated Injuries and Uſurpations, all having in direct Object the Eſtabliſhment of an abſolute Tyranny over theſe States. To prove this, let Facts be ſubmitted to a candid World.
<p>He has refuſed his Aſſent to Laws, the moſt wholeſome and neceſſary for the public Good.
<p>He has forbidden his Governors to paſs Laws of immediate and preſſing Importance, unleſs ſuſpended in their Operation till his Aſſent ſhould be obtained; and when ſo ſuſpended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

<p>He has called together Legiſlative Bodies at Places unuſual, uncomfortable, and diſtant from the Depoſitory of their public Records, for the ſole Purpoſe of fatiguing them into Compliance with his Meaſures.
<p>He has diſſolved Repreſentative Houſes repeatedly, for oppoſing with manly Firmneſs his Invaſions on the Rights of the People.
<p>He has refuſed for a long Time, after ſuch Diſſolutions, to cauſe others to be elected; whereby the Legiſlative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exerciſe; the State remaining in the meantime expoſed to all the Dangers of Invaſion from without, and Convulſions within.
<p>He has endeavored to prevent the Population of theſe States; for that Purpoſe obſtructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refuſing to paſs others to encourage their Migration hither, and raiſing the Conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.
<p>He has obſtructed the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, by refuſing his Aſſent to Laws for eſtabliſhing Judiciary Powers.
<p>He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the Tenure of their Offices, and the Amount and Payment of their Salaries.
<p>He has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and ſent hither Swarms of Officers to haraſs our People, and eat out their Subſtance.
<p>He has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing Armies without the conſent of our Legiſlature.
<p>He has affected to render the Military independent of and ſuperior to the Civil Power.
<p>He has combined with others to ſubject us to a Juriſdiction foreign to our Conſtitution, and unacknowledged by our Laws; giving his Aſſent to their Acts of pretended Legiſlation:
<p>For quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us:
<p>For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Puniſhment for any Murders which they ſhould commit on the Inhabitants of theſe States:
<p>For cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the World:
<p>For impoſing Taxes on us without our Conſent:
<p>For depriving us, in many Caſes, of the Benefits of Trial by Jury:
<p>For tranſporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended Offenſes:
<p>For aboliſhing the free Syſtem of Engliſh Laws in a neighboring Province, eſtabliſhing therein an arbitrary Government, and enlarging its Boundaries ſo as to render it at once an Example and fit Inſtrument for introducing the ſame abſolute Rule in theſe Colonies:
<p>For taking away our Charters, aboliſhing our moſt valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:
<p>For ſuſpending our own legiſlatures, and declaring themſelves inveſted with power to legiſlate for us in all caſes whatſoever.
<p>He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his protection and waging war againſt us.
<p>He has plundered our ſeas, ravaged our coaſts, burned our towns, and deſtroyed the lives of our people.
<p>He is at this time tranſporting large armies of foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death, deſolation and tyranny, already begun with circumſtances of cruelty and perfidy ſcarcely paralleled in the moſt barbarous ages, and totally unworthy of the head of a civilized nation.
<p>He has conſtrained our fellow citizens taken captive on the high ſeas to bear arms againſt their country, to become the executioners of their friends and brethren, or to fall themſelves by their hands.
<p>He has excited domeſtic inſurrections amongſt us, and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the mercileſs Indian ſavages, whoſe known rule of warfare, is undiſtinguiſhed deſtruction of all ages, ſexes and conditions.
<p>In every ſtage of theſe oppreſſions we have petitioned for redreſs in the moſt humble terms: our repeated petitions have been anſwered only by repeated injury. A prince, whoſe character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.
<p>Nor have we been wanting in attention to our Britiſh brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legiſlature to extend an unwarrantable juriſdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumſtances of our emigration and ſettlement here. We have appealed to their native juſtice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to diſavow theſe uſurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correſpondence. We muſt, therefore, acquieſce in the neceſſity, which denounces our ſeparation, and hold them, as we hold the reſt of mankind, enemies in war, in peace friends.
<p>We, therefore, the repreſentatives of the United States of America, in General Congreſs, aſſembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name, and by the authority of the good people of theſe colonies, ſolemnly publiſh and declare, that theſe united colonies are, and of right ought to be free and independent ſtates; that they are abſolved from all allegiance to the Britiſh Crown, and that all political connection between them and the ſtate of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally diſſolved; and that as free and independent ſtates, they have full power to levey war, conclude peace, contract alliances, eſtabliſh commerce, and to do all other acts and things which independent ſtates may of right do. And for the ſupport of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our ſacred honor.<br><br>
Signed by Order and in Behalf of the Congress,<br>
JOHN HANCOCK, President.</p></span>

<h1>Danish, pre-reform</h1>
<p><em>„Kongens Fald“ af Johannes V. Jensen</em><br>
Vejen bøjede tilvenstre over en Bro og ind gennem Serritslev By; Grøfterne laa med mørkt Græs og gule Smaablomster, ude over Markerne hvilede hist og her en hvid Blak, en Blomstertaage, i Skumringen. Solen var gaaet under, og Luften stod kølig klar, skyløs men uden Stjærner.
<p>Der kom et Hølæs kørende fra Landet ind i Serritslev By, langsomt og gyngende paa den vanskelige Vej. Som det listede afsted i Tusmørket ind gennem den snævre Landsbygade, lignede det et stort tottet, lavbenet Dyr, der trisser af fordybet i Betragtninger og snuser til Jorden.
<p>Læsset holdt udenfor Serritslev Kro; de svedige Heste vendte Hovedet tilbage og smagte paa Bidslet, de kunde nok lide at staa. Kusken lindede sig ned paa Hamlen, skrævede til Jorden og gjorde Tømmen fast. Saa vendte han sig mod Bislaget og raabte ind og snød Næsen.
<p>Er der nogen til færds—kanske?
<p>Hvad—der gik Lys i Ruderne, havde de tændt Lys derinde? I det samme kom en Pige frem i Døren. Kusken ønskede sig en Dram. Mens han ventede paa den, blev det levende oppe i Læsset, et Par lange Ben skød sig forsigtigt ned og følte efter Hamlen, selve Personen laa paa Maven og gryntede besværet. Ned kom han da og stod og rystede sig—et langt knoglet Menneske med Hætte over Hovedet.
<p>Singodt, sagde han. Karlen slog den røde Dram i sig og hostede behørigt. Om han ellers holdt videre, Kusken? De kunde jo altid gaa indenfor og tage en Snaps mere paa Følgeskabet.
<p>Men da de kom ind i Lyset, blev Kusken straks staaende ved Døren ramt af Ærefrygt; ogsaa den anden tabte Sikkerheden. Midt i Stuen ved Bordet sad fire fornemme Krigsfolk af den sachsiske Garde, der fornylig var kommen til Byen. De straalede af Klæder, deres røde, spækkede Ærmer, deres Fjer og Skæg fangede Øjet som en Glædesild. Lænet op mod Bordet og Bænkene stod Sværd og Spyd, gedigne Vaaben. Enhver kunde se, at Læderstropperne havde et Fald, der var kommet ved øvet Brug. Alle fire vendte Hovedet men saa straks paa hverandre indbyrdes igen og talte videre.
<p>Pigen bragte to Krus Øl hen til Døren og satte et Lys paa det lille Bord der. Hun var knap gaaet væk igen, før en af Knægtene henne i Stuen rakte sig i Sædet og brast i Latter.
<p>Se nu til ham der, ham med Hætten—det gør godt, hvor det kommer! Han talte tysk.
De andre vendte sig godmodigt, men de kunde heller ikke lade være at le. Den lange drak just, han stod op med bøjede Knæ, og idet en stor, spids Næse tonede ud af Hætten over Kruset, tog hele Figuren sig unægtelig morsom ud. Da han havde drukket, satte han sig roligt ned. Lyset faldt paa hans Øjne, han plirede hen til Bordet, halvt fornærmet, halvt varmt spottende som en Mand, der har Filosofi.
<p>Da rejste den ene af Knægtene sig, gik et Par Skridt frem i Stuen og tog høfligt tilorde paa sin tysk:
<p>Vor Lystighed var ikke ondt ment—gør De os ikke den Ære at drikke et Glas Vin?
Danke, sagde den lange og gik til Bordet med flere Skrabud. Før han skrævede over Bænken og satte sig, gjorde han en Bøjning mod hver især og nævnede sit Navn, Mikkel Thøgersen, studiosus. Saa henfaldt han til at purre i Haaret og slibe Haandfladerne op ad sine ru Kinder. Han hørte fire Navne blive sagt, hvoraf det ene lød dansk, og saa et Glas blodrød Vin brænde foran sig. Og Skaal, Skaal!
<p>Ihr Herren! Mikkel Thøgersen drak med Anstand og rettede sin stageagtige Krop, idet Vinen løb i ham. Han skød Blikket hastigt over Bordet og fikserede den ene af Herrerne, den yngste, der sad med Hovedet støttet i Haanden. Det var en hvid, tæt Haand uden synlige Aarer eller Knoer, Fingrene gravede i det lysebrune Haar. Ansigtet var langt—og Udtrykket deri fik pludselig Mikkel til at huske en Linedanser, han havde set en Gang ved et Marked, en ung Badutspringer, der sad ensom i en Krog uden at tage sig noget for—syg velsagtens. Mikkel huskede det unge, lidende Ansigt nu—netop saadanne Øjne havde han der. Men Mikkel syntes desuden, han skulde kende ham. Hvem var det, hvor var det? Han saa’ ud som en Adelsmand.
<p>Paany stod Glasset fyldt foran Mikkel Thøgersen. Han gjorde Besked med største Høviskhed, adspredt af at huske sig om og omtaaget ved Synet af Mennesket paa den anden Side Bordet. Der var en Mystik om det brune Hoved, og se der vendte han Brystet til. Armene sad i en paafaldende Afstand fra hinanden, det var en ualmindelig rank Skabning, han havde. Hvorfor havde han Sorg, Trækkene var mere egnede til Lystighed.
<p>Snakken gik, de fire Soldater begegnede Mikkel forekommende. Og Mikkel følte sig fuld af Tillid overfor disse Tyskere, der jo ikke kunde vide, at man kaldte ham for „Storken“ inde i Byen. Mikkel sprokkede tysk meget gelassent, men han blev atter og atter adspredt, kunde alligevel ikke lade være at tænke paa sit Øgenavn … paa den anden Side vidste Tyskerne her heller ikke, at han i en snævrere Kres var bekendt som <p>Ophavsmand til latinske Oder og Distika … hvorfor sagde den unge derovre ingenting? —
<p>Otte Iversen! Der faldt Navnet. Saa var det ham alligevel. Og Mikkel huskede i samme Nu en graa, brøstfældig Port, en Mur og et Spir—hjemme i Jylland—han følte sig selv staa klejn og elendig der udenfor. Han havde været der nogle Gange. Det var længe siden. Kun en eneste Gang havde han set ham … det var altsaa den Junker Otte, han havde skimtet inde i Gaarden som en spinkel Dreng og tænkt paa siden. Han stod derinde i en Flok Hunde og med en forpjusket Falk paa Tommelfingeren. Og nu sad han her, højvoksen, smal som en Pige.
<p>Knægtene smaalo. Mikkel Thøgersen tog sig sammen og drak igen.
<p>Kusken viste sig i Døren. Nu kører jeg, sagde han, og dermed satte han en Pose og en lille Halmkurv fuld af Æg ned paa Gulvet lige indenfor Døren, hvorpaa han lukkede igen for sig. Det var Mikkels Sager, Udbyttet af hans Tur paa Landet—der stod hans Forsmædelse ganske nøgen nede ved Døren; han vendte forvirret Ryggen dertil.
Men de tyske Soldater lo og fik en Idé—Æg var jo aldrig afvejen. Mikkel flyede da Æggene fra sig baade glad og fornedret, og de blev drukket allesammen, som de var. Otte Iversen vilde ingen have og sagde fremdeles ikke noget.
<p>Nu sad Mikkel Thøgersen paa Bænken, hed og flov og venlig, den lækre Vin befriede hans Tynge, og dog følte han sig ubodeligt mismodig. Hans Sjæl fløj de sorgløse Herrer imøde, og samtidig beholdt han en Frygt for at være dem prisgiven—og hele hans Humør begyndte at svømme og vugge i Rytme. Han skottede stjaalent til Junker Otte, forelsket i ham, mistroisk, logrende … kendte han ham mon ikke?—nej, gid han alligevel ikke kendte ham.
<p>Den ene af de tyske Knægte havde et Skaar i Overlæben slet dækket af Skægget, han kunde ikke tale rent, Mikkel Thøgersen hørte hans utætte Snak og morede sig vemodigt—han blev varm af alt, hvad han saa og hørte. Og medens Vinen og Velværet løste hans Sind, forhærdede han sig underneden, han følte en raa Kulde stige i sig, men han holdt den i Bunde og samlede sig.
<p>De tre Tyskere sværmede henne ved Skænken. Mikkel Thøgersen og Otte Iversen blev ene tilbage ved Bordet. Ingen af dem sagde noget, og Mikkel søgte at gaa i sig selv. Han saa ned i Mørket mellem Bordet og Bænken og fornam en bitterlig Ensomhed. Men han vilde slaa sig tiltaals, han sukkede og trak sine Rafter af Ben ind under sig, han tørrede Sveden af Panden og kom i Orden. Otte Iversen sad og drejede sit Bæger rundt, han saa fremdeles ud som han var syg.
<p>Da Knægtene kom igen med nyopdagede Drikkesorter, skikkede Mikkel Thøgersen sig mere samlet, han drak forstandigt og uden Uro. Nu svirede de allesammen tæt og tænkte ikke paa andet. Otte Iversen tømte Bægret saa tit det blev fyldt og undergik ikke fjærneste Forandring derved. Clas, ham med Skaaret i Læben, stemte op med en Sang, det lød ikke saa lidt besynderligt.
<p>Mikkel Thøgersen tog et af de vældige Tohaandssværd og vejede det prøvende i Haanden—de viste ham Tagene. Hver Gang den hvasse Od vendte imod ham, trak det ondt som en iskold Vind ned gennem hans Rygrad—det undrede ham, han var nu ellers ikke bange for Kniven.</p>

<p><em>Peter Seeberg „Forsinkelse“</em><br>
Dust tog aldrig sovevogn den ene gang om året, hvor han foretog sin lange rejse til kongressen. Han forklarede hende, at han hellere ville sidde med hovedet inde i sin frakke i hjørnet af en anden klasses kupé. Intet var bedre. Bumpe lidt med nakken mod trævæggen, falde hen med ekspressens lange løb under sig, sove ind et øjeblik, vågne til blank vågenhed med uldfrotteret varme i ansigtet, slå frakken til side, trække ruden ned og stikke det svulne ansigt ud til afkøling i den regnfyldte blæst. Lade sig dumpe i sæde igen og lade dråberne flyve hen over hovedet, til der blev svalt i den tomme kupé. Tænke på livet. Store øjeblikke. Tale med mennesker, der kom ind og som gik igen. Stå ud på stationer. Møde mennesker i ventesale, mens én eller anden formalitet, som kun køreplanseksperterne forstod, holdt toget tilbage tolv minutter, en halv time, eller en time og treogtyve minutter. Drikke en kop kaffe, nyde en cognac. Han ville ikke undvære det. Derfor skulle ingen få ham til at benytte sovevogn.
<p>Hun smilte ad ham, mens han talte. Han lagde mærke til, at hendes venstre øje var en lille bitte smule større end hendes højre øje, at hendes venstre øjenbryn lå en lille bitte smule lavere over øjet end det højre bryn over det højre øje.
<p>Det var gået så let at møde hende. Han havde netop fået trukket sin mappe ind gennem den raske svingdør, da hun bumpede mod den ene dørfløj i dens knaldende tilbagebevægelse. Hun havde opfanget dens slag med kufferten, men havde ikke straks kunnet skyde den op. Da havde han været der og havde draget den op for hende og havde undskyldt sig. Hun havde leet af ham og havde sat sig ind og stillet kufferten fra sig og taget handskerne af og set sig om i ventesalen, hvor der sad et par mænd og sov med hovederne på bordet, mens en mager kvinde sad rank på en bænk og så lige frem for sig og en servitrice stod bag en buffet og skyllede glas i en zink.
<p>Der var så højt i rummet. De havde stået begge og sundet sig, men så havde han taget hendes kuffert og de havde set på hinanden og havde fulgtes ad hen til et bord uden for lampelysets skarpeste felt, hvor de havde sat sig ned, og han havde fået bestilt lidt kaffe til dem, mens han uafladeligt så på hende, der hele tiden kom til at smile ad ham.
<p>Alt var en lille smule skævt ved hende, havde han snart opdaget. Munden hang en lille kende ned ved den ene mundvig, den ene kind var næsten ukendeligt fuldere end den anden, ja denne lille skævhed gik igen i alle synlige legemsdele, men det gjorde ham kun godt. Han fandt det tilmed sandsynligt, at han selv i hendes øjne besad lignende småfejl, ja, han ønskede, at hun måtte se alle hans skavanker på samme måde, som han havde set hendes.
<p>Han fik sagt sit navn i forbindelse med en historie, som han selv figurerede i, men det var ham ikke gørligt blot at spørge hende, hvad hun hed. Det skulle komme af sig selv, syntes han. Det havde været tåbeligt. Netop det havde været det tåbeligste, fordi det ikke mere var til at genoprette. Ikke én eneste af annoncerne havde virket.
<p>De havde drukket en kop kaffe sammen. Han snakkede og så ofte op på uret. Hun så aldrig op på uret. Hun så ned på sit venstre håndled, når hun ikke så på ham med sin underlige skælmske strålen. Hun så også nu og da over på én af mændene, der havde hovedet boret ned mellem armene på bordet, og Dust fulgte skinsygt hendes blik og mødtes glad med det skråt ude i rummet og svang det ligesom tilbage igen til deres midte.
Han ville fortælle hende alt om sit liv. Han lagde sin hånd lidt frem på bordet. Hun lagde sin højre blidt over hans. Han havde ikke ventet det, men han blev oprømt. Han mistede holdet på historien om sit liv, det var som om det først lige var begyndt. Han foreslog, at de skulle gå ud.
<p>De var gået ud på perronen, hvor regnen dryppede fra de halvrådne tage, hvor postautomobilerne kørte op til postvognene, hvor en portør bankede på hvert hjul i en togstamme, mens togførerne stod i klump og talte sammen med store papmapper under armen.
<p>Dust lagde hånden om hendes skulder, hun søgte hans anden hånd bag om hans ryg. Sådan passerede de vognene og lokomotivet og gik yderst ud på perronen, hvor snerpende røg fra rangerlokomotiverne undertiden slog ind over dem. Her slap han hende og så ned på hende og omfavnede hende. Højtaleren var begyndt at tale om natekspressen midt i et kys.
<p>Forsinkelse på en time og femogtredive minutter.
<p>De drev ind ad perronen, hånd i hånd, ud ad gitterlågen til stationspladsen, hvor taxachaufførerne sad og læste morgenaviserne i deres biler. De gik ind i de mindst lyse gader, videre ind i de mørkeste, stod stille under lygterne, på hjørnerne, prøvede at ruske et par portdøre op.
<p>De gik gennem lurvede toetagers kvarterer med uasfalterede fortove og brolagte kørebaner, hvor alt lugtede af gas og våde kulbjerge bag spændte plankeværker. Han tænkte på tiden, der gik, som han ikke måtte tænke på.
<p>De måtte få alt ud af den knappe tid. De vendte om ved en tværgade og gik på må og få, men stadig i retning af stationen. Hun sagde ingenting til ham, han fortalte klagende om sit dagligliv og om den årlige rejse, og hun strøg hans hånd. På hånden sad en ring, mærkede han, men han ville ikke spørge. De satte sig ind i et af sporvejenes læskure og omklamrede hinanden, sikre på den snarlige adskillelse. Han måtte sige sådan noget som hvad de dog skulle gøre, hvorfor de dog ikke kunne afbryde deres rejser, men hun svarede ham ikke. Hun kærtegnede ham blot. Tiden tog fart, mærkede han. De rejste sig og gik videre. Han skød en halvåben port op og førte hende ind i det mørkeste hjørne med dens fugtige lugt. Her stod de længe, gennemblæst af hverandres ånde. Hun hang som en krøbling om hans hals og hofter. Derpå gik de videre, mens ensomheden og kulden lidt efter lidt satte sig i blodet. Han ville gøre modstand og søgte efter ord, der skulle bringe en ny blomstring, men det faldt ham lettest at sige, at de allerede kunne se stationen med det lysende ur over indgangen. Han spurgte hende, hvilket tog hun skulle med. Han købte chokolade i en automat, tømte fire smårum og stak til hende. Hun morede sig over ham, det var alt for galt. Da de gik over stengulvet i ventesalen, hørte han, at hendes hælslag lød lidt forskelligt. Det ene ben var en smule kortere end det andet.
<p>Hun blev stående og friserede sig foran et spejl, mens han hentede hendes kuffert og sin taske. Da han kom tilbage, så han alle hendes små bitte skævheder, han så dem atter tydeligt. Men de betød ikke noget. Han sagde til hende, at hun havde givet ham så meget, så meget, som han aldrig havde vidst eksisterede af lykke. Hun svarede ham let, men dog med en vemodig glans i øjnene, at hun var fuldstændig lykkelig, at hun aldrig skulle glemme dette møde, at det ville vare evigt, fordi det nu blev afsluttet. Han bad hende sige, hvad hun hed, men hun rystede på hovedet. Han kunne mindes hende som en elsket fra stationen i Tauben.
<p>De fulgtes ud på perronen gennem tunnelen. Deres tog afgik fra hver sit spor, de tætte trucks til rejsegodset var allerede på vej over sporene. Togets dundren voksende, mens de stod og ventede.
<p>„Og så skal vi aldrig ses mere,“ sagde Dust.
<p>„Nej,“ sagde hun, „aldrig mere.“
<p>„Det kan ikke være rigtigt,“ sagde Dust, “det er som at dø.“
<p>„Ja,“ sagde hun, „sådan er det at dø.“
<p>Hun steg ind i det ventende tog, der skulle afgå straks efter at natekspressen kom ind på sit spor. Hun gik ind i sidegangen og trak et vindue ned.
<p>Natekspressen fór ind langs perronen.
<p>„Sig mig, hvad du hedder,“ sagde Dust.
<p>Toget satte i gang. Han så efter hende. Hun havde en hånd løftet, lidt krummet, til afsked. Hendes øjne var allerede skjult.
<p>Han var gået et par skridt baglæns, havde vendt sig mod sit tog. Han havde prøvet at kalde hende noget, men intet navn slog til.</p>

<p><em>August Strindberg „Röda rummet”</em><br>
Och det är höst igen; det är en klar novembermorgon då Arvid Falk beger sig från sin numera eleganta bostad på Storgatan till den manska flickpensionen vid Karl <nobr>ⅩⅢ</nobr>:s torg, där han skall göra sitt inträde som lärare i Svenska Språket och Historien. Han har väl begagnat höstmånaderna för att göra sitt återinträde i det civiliserade samhället och har därvid erfarit vilken barbar han under sina strövtåg blivit; han har avlagt sin rövarhatt och skaffat sig en ny, hög, vilken till en början hade svårt att sitta kvar; han har köpt sig handskar, men var så förvildad, att när mamselln i boden frågade hans nummer, svarade han 15, vilket framkallade en hel hop små skratt från de många mamsellerna därinne; modet har undergått stora förändringar, sedan han sist köpte sig kläder och han tycker sig som en söndagssprätt, när han går fram på gatorna, och han speglar sig då och då i bodfönsterna för att se efter om allting sitter rätt. Nu går han av och an på trottoaren utanför Dramatiska Teatern och väntar att klockan i Jakob skall slå nio; han känner sig orolig och besvärad, alldeles som när han själv skulle gå i skolan; trottoaren är för kort, och han tycker sig löpa som en hund i en kedja, när han vänder och vänder på sina spår; ett ögonblick tänker han allvarsamt på att sträcka ut promenaden, långt ut, ty han vet att man kommer till Lill-Jans om man fortsätter gatan framåt och han erinrar sig den morgonen då samma trottoar ledde honom ut från det samhälle han flydde till friheten, naturen och – slaveriet!
<p>Klockan blir nio! Han står i tamburen; dörrarne till skolsalen äro stängda; i skymningen ser han så många små barnplagg hänga runtomkring väggarne; hattar, boas, kråkor, baschliks, vantar, muffar ligga på borden och i fönsternischerna och på golven stå hela regementen med knäppkängor och galoscher. Men det luktar icke fuktiga kläder och vått läder som i tamburen på riksdagen, eller arbetarförbundet Nordstjärnan, eller – ah, det gick en doft som av nyslaget hö förbi – den kom bestämt från den där lilla muffen, som är vit som en kattunge med svarta noppor och blått sidenfoder med hängande tofsar; han kunde icke underlåta att ta den i sin hand och låta parfymen new-mown hay – men farstudörren öppnas, och in kommer en liten tioåring åtföljd av sin jungfru; hon ser på magistern med ett par stora orädda ögon och gör en liten kokett nigning, vilken magistern nästan förlägen besvarar med en bugning, varvid den lilla skönheten ler – och jungfrun också! Hon kommer för sent, men det tyckes icke skrämma henne, ty hon låter jungfrun ta av sig ytterkläder och bottiner med en min så lugn som om hon kommit till en bal. Nu – vilka ljud inifrån rummen – det knäppte i hans bröst – vad var det? – Ah – Det var ju orgeln! Hm! Gamla orgeln! Ja!
<p>Och en hel här av barnröster sjunga: Jesu låt mig städse börja! Han känner sig illa till mods och han får lov att tänka på Borg och Isaac för att återvinna fattningen. Men nu blir det ändå värre: Fader Vår som är i himmelen! – Herre Gud, ja! Gamla Fadervår! Det var inte i går det… Det blir tyst, så tyst, att man hör huru hela hären av små huvuden böja sig och skrynkla kragar och förklän och så slås dörrarne upp och ett helt blomsterland av unga flickor från åtta till fjorton år bölja fram och tillbaka. Han känner sig blyg och får nästan känslor som en ertappad tjuv, då den gamla föreståndarinnan räcker honom sin hand och ber honom vara välkommen; då blir en rörelse i blomsterlandet och det viskas och det växlas blickar och det tisslas och det tasslas.
<p>Och nu sitter han där vid ena ändan av ett långt bord omgiven av tjugo friska ansikten med glada blickar, tjugo barn som aldrig känt jordelivets bittraste sorg, fattigdomens förödmjukelse; och de möta hans blickar djärvt och nyfiket, men han är blyg innan han kommer sig före; men snart är han intim med Anne-Charlotte och Georgine och Lisen och Harry och lektionen går som ett nöje, och udda får vara jämt, och Ludvig <nobr>ⅩⅠⅤ</nobr> och Alexander få fortfarande vara stora som alla vilka lyckats, och franska revolutionen var en förfärlig händelse som tog ett olyckligt slut på den ädle Ludvig <nobr>ⅩⅤⅠ</nobr> och den dygdiga Marie Antoinette och så där. Och när han sen gick upp i Kollegiet för Kavalleriregimentenas höleveranser kände han sig helt varm och föryngrad.
<p>I nämnda kollegium där han läste Den Konservative satt han till klockan elva, då han gick upp i Kansliet för brännvinstillverkningen; där åt han frukost och skrev två brev – till Borg och Struve.
<p>På slaget ett är han i Departementet för beskattningen på avlidne. Där kollationerar han en bouppteckning på vilket han gör sig en hundra riksdaler, varefter han innan middagen har så mycken tid över att han kan läsa ett korrektur på en nyreviderad upplaga av skogslagen, som han håller på att ge ut. Och så blir klockan tre. Den som då går över Riddarhustorget skall på bron möta en ung herre med viktig uppsyn, pappersrullar i fickorna och händerna på korsryggen i sakta mak vandra fram sida om sida med en gammal mager gråsprängd herre på femtiotalet. Det är aktuarien för de avlidne; alla som dö inom stadens tullar måste till den mannen uppge vad de äga, varefter han tar sin procent; några säga att detta är hans syssla, andra mena att han representerar jorden och skall se efter att de döda icke ta något med sig härifrån, där allt är ett lån – utan procent! Nog av, han är en man som mera intresserar sig för de döda än för de levande och därför har Falk funnit sig så väl i hans sällskap; varför han hyllar sig till Falk är därför att han samlar mynt och autografer – som han själv och därför att han är så fri från opposition, något så ovanligt hos ungt folk. Nu gå de båda gamla vännerna till Rosengrens, där de äro tämligen lugna för att träffa ungt folk och där tala de numismatik och autografi. Därpå dricka de kaffe i en soffa på Rydberg och pricka myntkataloger till klockan 6, då Posttidningen kommer och de få läsa utnämningarna. De äro så lyckliga i varandras sällskap, ty de komma aldrig i tvist; Falk är så fri från åsikter att han är bliven den mest älskvärda människa och är därför avhållen och värderad av förmän och kamrater. I bland dröja de sig kvar och äta då en bit mat på Hamburger Börs, och ta sedan en »lasse» på Operakällarn, kanske två också. Om man då får se dem klockan elva komma tultande arm i arm oppåt Ladugårdslandet så är det riktigt vackert att se. Han är mycket ofta på middagar och supéer, hos familjer dit Borgs pappa infört honom; fruntimmerna tycka att han är intressant, men de veta aldrig var de ha honom, ty han ler jämt och säger dem dessemellan trevliga elakheter.
<p>Men när han blir led på familjeliv och samhällslögn då går han ner i Röda Rummet och där träffar han den ryslige Borg, sin beundrare Isaac, sin hemlige fiende och avundsman Struve, som aldrig har pengar, och den sarkastiske Sellén, som så småningom håller på att lyckas för andra gången, sedan alla hans imitatörer först vant publiken vid det nya maneret. Lundell, som övergivit den religiösa känslan, sedan hans altartavla blev färdig och nu lever på att måla porträtt, vilken sysselsättning medför en oändlighet av enskilda middagsbjudningar, och små supéer, vilka samkväm han påstår vara nödvändiga för att »studera karaktären», har blivit en fet epikuré, som aldrig kommer i Röda Rummet annars än då han behöver äta och dricka gratis. Olle som ännu är arbetare hos ornamentsbildhuggaren och som blivit dyster och människofientlig efter sitt stora nederlag som politikus och talare, vill icke »genera» sällskapet utan går för sig själv och vallar. Falk är yster och vild när han kommer i Röda Rummet och Borg tycker sig ha mycken heder av honom; ja, han är en sannskyldig sappör för vilken ingenting är heligt – utom politiken; – den rör han aldrig vid. Men ser han då, under det han till de andras förlustelse bränner av sina raketkistor, genom tobaksmolnen den dystre Olle på andra sidan av salen, då blir han mörk som en natt på havet och då tar han in stora kvantiteter starka saker, som om han ville släcka en eld eller brinna upp. Men nu har Olle icke visat sig på länge!</p>

<p><em>Fridtjof Nansen «Fram over Polhavet»</em><br>
Om kvelden den dagen – 28. september – flyttet vi endelig inn i vår nye hytte. Men det blev en kold natt, den første vi hadde der. Hittil hadde vi jo hele tiden ligget sammen i én pose, og selv den vi hadde laget ved å sy sammen de to ullteppene våre, hadde vært noenlunde tilstrekkelig. Men nu mente vi at det ikke skulde være nødvendig å ligge i fellespose lenger; når vi brente tranlamper i hytten, skulde vi få den så varm at vi godt kunde nøie oss med å ligge på hver vår køi med et ullteppe over oss, og følgelig hadde vi sprettet posen op. Lamper fikk vi ved å bukke op kantene på noen nysølvplater, fylle dem med knust spekk, og så legge noen tøistykker fra bandasjene i apoteket op i dem til veker. De brant utmerket, lyste også så godt at vi syntes det var koselig å se på. Men nok til å varme hytten, som ennu var nokså utett, var og blev det ikke, og vi lå og frøs og skalv hele natten; vi syntes mest det var den sureste natt vi hadde hatt. Næste morgen smakte frokosten fortreffelig, og det var meget kokende bjørnebuljong vi kjørte i oss for å få litt varme i kroppen igjen. Vi tok straks og forandret det, slik at vi langs bakveggen av hytten fikk istand en brisk så bred at vi kunde ligge begge ved siden av hverandre; ullteppene blev sydd sammen igjen, bjørnefelder bredde vi under oss, så vi efter omstendighetene lå godt, og vi gjorde ikke oftere forsøk på å skille lag om natten. Det var ikke mulig å få underlaget noenlunde jevnt med de kantete, knudrete stenene som var det eneste som stod til vår rådighet, nu da alt var frosset, og hele vinteren lå vi derfor og kastet og vred på oss for å få et tålelig leie innimellem alle knultrene; men hårdt var det og blev det, alltid var vi ømme på flere steder av kroppen, og det gikk så vidt at vi fikk sår på hoftene av å ligge. Men sove gjorde vi nu like fullt. I det ene hjørnet av hytten bygget vi en liten peis til å koke og steke på; i taket ovenover skar vi et rundt hull gjennem hvalross-skinnet, og av bjørneskinn laget vi oss en peishette, som førte op dit. Vi hadde ikke kokt der lenge før vi innså nødvendigheten av å bygge en pipe, for å hindre vinden fra å slå ned. Hytten blev nemlig så fylt av røk at det stundom ikke var til å holde ut. Det eneste materiale vi hadde til bygging var is og sne; men av det laget vi på taket en flott pipe, som gjorde tjenesten og gav god trekk. Riktig varig var den ellers ikke; hullet i den vidde sig stadig ved bruk, og det var ikke fritt for at det stundom kunde dryppe ned i peisen. Men det var da rik tilgang på den slags byggefang, så det var ikke vanskelig å fornye pipen når den blev skrøpelig. Det måtte vi gjøre et par ganger i løpet av vinteren. På altfor utsatte punkter anbragte vi hvalrosskjøtt, ben og annet slikt for å bedre på den.
<p>Vårt matstell var så enkelt som mulig. Det var å koke bjørnekjøtt og suppe (buljong) om morgenen og steke biff om kvelden. Middag holdt vi ikke. Det var svære mengder vi satte til livs hvert mål, og merkelig var det at vi aldri blev kjed av denne maten, men stadig åt med glupende mathug. Alt efter som det falt sig, spiste vi spekk til eller dyppet kjøttstykkene i litt tran. Det kunde også gå lange tider da vi spiste næsten bare kjøtt og ikke smakte videre fett; men fikk vi så lyst på det fete igjen, kunde det hende vi fisket op noen brente spekkstykker i lampene, eller spiste restene av de spekkstykkene vi hadde smeltet lampetran av. Dem kalte vi bakkels, og syntes de var ualmindelig lekre. Vi fantaserte stadig om hvor det vilde vært deilig om vi kunde hatt litt sukker på dem.
<p>Ennu hadde vi en del igjen av den sledeproviant vi hadde ført med oss fra «Fram»; men den vilde vi ikke bruke noe av om vinteren; den blev lagt i et depot for å gjemmes til våren, når vi skulde reise videre. Depotet blev vel dekket med sten, for å hindre revene fra å trekke avsted med posene. De var så menn nærgående nok, og tok alt løsøre de kunde få fatt på. Således opdaget jeg den 10. oktober at de hadde dratt avsted med en hel del småsaker jeg hadde hatt liggende i et annet depot mens vi bygget på hytten; de hadde tatt alt som de på noen måte kunde bære med sig, slikt som stykker av bambusrør, ståltråd, harpun og harpunline, min samling av stener, moser o. l., som var opbevart i små seilduksposer. Det verste av alt var ellers næsten at de også hadde dratt avsted med et snørenøste, som hadde vært vår trøst og vårt håp, for vi hadde regnet på å lage oss tråd av det snøret, når vi skulde til å sy klær, fottøi og sovepose av bjørneskinn til vinteren. Godt var det at de ikke også hadde reist avsted med teodolitten og de andre instrumentene som stod der, men de har vel vært for tunge for dem. Jeg var sint — og så skulde det til og med være på min egen fødselsdag! Og bedre blev det ikke da jeg i tusmørket gikk og rotet om i uren ovenfor der jeg hadde hatt sakene liggende, for å se om jeg iallfall ikke kunde finne i hvilken retning de djevlene hadde dratt avsted med dem, og jeg så møtte en rev som stanset op ti alen fra mig, satte sig ned og utstøtte noen forbitrede hyl, så skjærende og uhyggelige at en helst måtte holde sig for ørene. Den var tydeligvis på veien til sakene mine igjen, og var ergerlig over å bli forstyrret. Jeg fikk tak i noen store stener og slengte efter den; den skvatt unda et stykke, men satte sig oppe på brekanten og hylte videre, mens jeg rasende gikk hjem i hytten, la mig til køis, og spekulerte på hvad vi skulde gjøre for å hevne oss på disse udyrene. Vi kunde ikke avse patroner til å skyte dem; men en stenfelle kunde vi alltid lage. Men det blev med forsettet; der var alltid så meget annet å gjøre nu i begynnelsen, mens det ennu var lyst nok til å finne passelige stener, før sneen hadde dekket uren. Imidlertid blev revene ved å gjøre ugagn. En dag hadde de trukket avsted med termometret vårt, som vi stadig hadde utenfor hytten. Forgjeves lette vi efter det i lang tid, inntil vi endelig fant det gravet ned i en snehaug et stykke unda. Fra nu av var vi meget omhyggelige med å legge en sten over det om natten; men en morgen fant vi at reven hadde fått veltet vekk stenen og var dratt av med det igjen. Det eneste vi dengangen fant, var futteralet, som den hadde kastet fra sig et stykke borte; termometret selv fikk vi aldri se mere; det hadde føket om natten, så sporene var forsvunnet. Gud vet hvilken revekule det nu pryder! Efter den dag hadde vi lært å tjore det termometret vi hadde igjen.
<p>Hele vinteren holdt revene til ved hytten vår. Stadig hørte vi dem gnage på de frosne bjørneskinkene og skrottene der oppe på taket, så det klang i den kolde hårdføkne sneen. Vi jog dem aldri bort, der var selskap i disse husdyrene; ofte kunde vi ligge i halvsøvne og bille oss inn at vi lå hjemme og hørte rottene og musene regjere på loftet over oss; — vi hørte hvorledes de sloss og fór rundt deroppe, og rett som det var, tittet de ned gjennem peispipen til oss. Vi unte dem gjerne litt av vår overflod så lenge de bare vilde holde sig til kjøttet, som de også helst spiste. Men begynte de å dra på spekkstykkene våre, blev vi sinte; dem hadde vi ikke så god råd på. Når vi gikk og spaserte i mørket, hendte det ikke sjelden at vi hørte det tuslet omkring oss, og så kunde vi skimte skikkelsen av en rev, som kanskje satte sig tett ved oss for å kikke på oss. De var som oftest hvite; men der var også mange blå-rever, med vakker sortblå pels. En av disse kom ofte igjen; vi kjente den på et særlig stygt iltert skrik, som den satte i hver gang den kom oppe på brekammen og merket at en av oss var ute, så den ikke uforstyrret kunde gå like på kjøtthaugen vår. Men ikke før hadde vi dukket ned i hytten, før vi hørte det gnog på taket igjen.
En gang blev det da virkelig gjort et forsøk på å fange dem. Johansen laget en felle av et frossent hvalross-skinn, som han satte stillepinner under, og som blev godt lastet med sten, så det blev en ganske bra fall-lem. Denne fellen stillet han op på taket over hodet vårt, og så satt vi og lydde og lydde, for å høre når den falt. Da han kom ut næste morgen, var fellen nede, men der lå ingen rev under. Derimot hadde den dratt avsted både med stillepinnene og agnen hans; den ene pinnen fant vi igjen lenge efter langt ute på isen. Efter det gav Johansen op den fangsten.
<p>Imens gikk tiden, solen sank lavere og lavere, inntil vi den 15. oktober så den for siste gang over åsen i syd; dagene blev hurtig mørkere, og så begynte da den tredje polarnatten.
<p>To bjørner til skjøt vi om høsten, den 8. og den 21. oktober; men efter den tid så vi ingen før våren. Da jeg våknet om morgenen den 8. november, hørte jeg det knaste av tunge skritt i sneen utenfor, og så tok det på å rumstere i kjøttet og spekket vårt oppå taket. Jeg skjønte det var bjørn, og krøp ut med børsen; men da jeg kom op av husgangen, kunde jeg ingenting se i måneskinnet. Dyret hadde merket mig, og var alt vekk. Og det var oss forsåvidt ikke imot som vi hadde liten lyst til å ta på det sure arbeidet med å flå i vind og 39° kulde.
<p>Det var ikke meget avveksling vi hadde. Livet bestod i en to-tre ting: Først å koke og spise frokosten om morgenen. Derefter kanskje en lur igjen, og så en tur ut for å få litt bevegelse. Men det gjorde vi allikevel minst mulig av, da våre klær ikke nettop egnet sig for ophold i friluft om vinteren, gjennemtrukket som de var av fett, og for resten slitt og hullet på flere kanter. Vindklærne, som vi skulde ha over til vern mot vinden, var så stygt medtatt og opflengt at vi ikke kunde bruke dem, og tråd til å lappe med hadde vi ikke så meget av at jeg syntes vi hadde råd til å bruke den før våren, når vi skulde reise. Jeg hadde gjort regning på å kunne sy oss klær av bjørneskinn. Men å få skinnene renset for fett tok tid. Og enda senere gikk det å få tørket dem. Den eneste måten vi kunde få gjort det på var ved å spile dem op under taket i hytten, og der var det ikke plass til mer enn ett av gangen. Fikk vi så endelig et par ferdig, måtte vi først og fremst bruke dem til sengen vår — vi lå på rå fettede skinn, som litt efter litt råtnet. Når vi så langt om lenge hadde fått underlaget i sengen i orden med tørre skinn, så måtte vi tenke på å lage oss en sovepose; det blev noe koldt i lengden å ligge i den ullteppeposen vi hadde. Ved juletider fikk vi da til slutt istand en bjørneskinnspose. På den måten gikk de skinn vi kunde få tørket, og det endte med at vi blev gående vinteren over i de klærne vi hadde.
<p>Disse spaserturene var en sur fornøielse også av den grunn at det støtt og stadig blåser deroppe, og vinden tok hårdt under den bratte fjellveggen. Vi syntes det var vidunderlig velgjørende når det en enkelt gang hendte at det var så noenlunde stilt. Som oftest hvinte stormen om oss, og pisket sneen avsted, så alt stod i et rokk. Da kunde det gå mange dager hvor vi næsten ikke satte nesen ut gjennem husgangen, og da var det bare den hårde nød som drev oss ut, hver gang vi skulde hente noe is til drikkevann, eller et bjørnelår. eller en skrott til mat, eller noe spekk til brensel. Som regel tok vi også inn noe salt sjø-is, eller om der var en åpning eller sprekk å finne, litt sjøvann til suppen vår, for å få mere smak på den.
Når vi kom inn og hadde fått opdrevet matlyst til et nytt mål, bar det til med å lage kveldsmat, spise sig god og mett, og så stikke sig ned i posen, og sove mest mulig for å få tiden til å gå. I det hele hadde vi det ganske bra i hytten vår. Med tranlampene våre kunde vi holde temperaturen midt i rummet på omkring frysepunktet. Ved veggene var det betydelig koldere, og der slo fuktigheten sig ned i vakre rimblomster; stenene var helt hvite, og lampeskinnet blev kastet tilbake og funklet fra tusen krystallflater, så vi i lykkelige stunder kunde drømme oss i en marmorhall. Denne prakt måtte riktignok betales dyrt, for ved væromslag ute, eller når vi stekte og braste meget, da rant den i bekker nedover og inn i soveposen til oss.</p>

<p><em>„Hjartað í miðju alls“ eftir Þröst Helgason</em><br>
Halldór Laxness kvaddi sér fyrst hljóðs sem rithöfundur árið 1919 með skáldsögunni Barni náttúrunnar. Halldór var aðeins sautján ára þegar bókin kom út en það mátti samt ekki tæpara standa því, eins og hann sagði sjálfur frá, fékk hann vitrun fyrir dyrum úti þegar hann var sjö ára um að hann myndi deyja á sautjánda ári.
<p>Vorið 1918 var ég semsé orðinn sextán vetra og lítill tími til stefnu. Ekki var ég fyrr kominn heim af gagnfræðaprófi þetta vor en ég tók til óspiltra mála að skrifa þá bók sem á reið að eftir mig lægi þegar liði upp af mér, vonandi í leiftri af himni, næsta vor. Bókina ætlaði ég að grundvalla á sýn merkilegrar stúlku sem einusinni hafði horft á mig án þess að mæla orð, einsog á myndinni af Dante þegar hann mætti Beatrice á brúarsporðinum við Arnó-fljót og hvorugt mælti orð. Eftir það hafði ég gert því skóna að öll viska heimsins mundi búa í svona stúlku; amk birtast gegnum hana; þó er það von mín að slíkrar stúlku hafi beðið skemmtilegri ævi en sú sem boðuð er stúlkunni í Barni náttúrunnar. Kanski skiptir það ekki máli; nema þatta var skáldsagan sem ég hafði heitstrengt að skrifa áður en ég yrði sautján ára; deya síðan glaður.
<p>Bókin hlaut góðar viðtökur hjá gagnrýnendum. Jakob Jóhannesson Smári sagði í grein í Skírni að engum þyrfti að dyljast að höfundur Barns náttúrunnar væri efni í skáld þótt verkið hefði nokkra galla; „… grunar mig, að hann eigi eftir að auðga íslenskar bókmenntir með góðum skáldskap, ef honum endist aldur og heilsa.“ Í Alþýðublaðinu birtist einnig ítarlegur ritdómur eftir Arnfinn Jónsson sem, eins og Jakob, gerir smávægilegar athugasemdir við bókina, en segist telja að vænta megi hins besta frá höfundinum „þegar honum vex aldur og viska“. Arnfinnur bætir svo þessum orðum við: „Og hver veit nema að Halldór frá Laxnesi eigi eftir að verða óskabarn íslensku þjóðarinnar.“<br><br>
<em>Æskuár ­ þreifað fyrir sér</em><br>
Halldór Laxness fæddist í steinbæ á Laugavegi 32 í Reykjavík 23. apríl 1902. Á þessum árum var Reykjavík aðeins þorp sem um 10% þjóðarinnar bjuggu í, jafnmargir bjuggu í smábæjum víða um landið en 80% í sveitum. En Reykjavík stækkaði ört næstu áratugina. Þar bjó þriðjungur þjóðarinnar árið 1940, annar þriðjungur bjó þá í öðrum bæjum en aðeins um 40% í sveitum. Upp úr aldamótunum var Reykjavík í óða önn að verða miðstöð íslensks þjóðlífs, hún varð miðpunktur viðskipta, stjórnmála og menningar. Halldór staldraði hins vegar stutt við í verðandi höfuðstað landsins. Þegar hann var þriggja ára flutti hann ásamt foreldrum sínum upp í Mosfellsdal þar sem þau hófu búskap í Laxnesi.
<p>Halldór var sonur Guðjóns Helga Helgasonar, bónda og vegaverkstjóra, og Sigríðar Halldórsdóttur húsfreyju. Bæði voru þau listhneigð. Guðjón lék á fiðlu og var söngmaður góður eins og Sigríður. Halldóri var ungum haldið að tónlistariðkun, lærði hann meðal annars á píanó en einnig naut hann tilsagnar í dráttlist hjá ekki ómerkari listmálara en Þórarni B. Þorlákssyni. En skáldhneigðin varð öllu öðru yfirsterkari og á þrettánda ári hafði Halldór skrifað sexhundruð blaðsíðna reyfara, sem hann kallaði svo, „reyfara á móti Endurlausnarkenningunni og frú Torfhildi Hólm“. Sagan hét Afturelding og hefur ekkert varðveist af handriti hennar; sagði Halldór að hann hefði gefið hana upp á bátinn er hann fermdist enda hefði sumt í henni ekki samræmst þankagangi kristinna manna.
<p>Áhrif gamalla kvenna á skáld hafa orðið eins konar leiðarminni í íslenskum bókmenntum frá því að Halldór Laxness hélt því fram að móðuramma sín, Guðný Klængsdóttir, hefði haft mest áhrif á skáldskap sinn en ekki einhver bókmenntapáfinn, stórskáld eða hugsuður. Halldór gerði íslenskar ömmur að bókmenntalegri stærð sem yngri höfundar hafa svo oft vísað í. Hann sagði að amma sín hefði ekki aðeins kennt honum að segja sögu heldur hefði hann einnig numið íslensku af hennar vörum, þá kjarnmiklu íslensku sem ömmur í gegnum aldirnar hafa varðveitt og borið frá kynslóð til kynslóðar. Það var þessi alþýðlega menntun úr ríkulegum sjóði amma allra kynslóða sem Halldór vildi halda fram að hefði mótað hans skáldskap. Og svo mikið er víst að það var ekki hinn hefðbundni skólavegur sem skóp Halldór Laxness.
<p>Halldór sótti nám við Menntaskólann í Reykjavík en undi sér illa; þótti honum lítið gagn vera af þeim fróðleik sem nemendur þar áttu að innbyrða en sagðist þó hafa lært miklu meira þar en hann gerði sér grein fyrir í fyrstu, og það „með því einu að sitja þarna geispandi af utanviðsigheitum, og sjá alt í þoku kringum sig.“ Halldór hafði aðeins setið í liðlega hálfan vetur í skólanum þegar hann þoldi ekki lengur við; hann tók þá ákvörðun að leita sér frekar þekkingar með því að skoða heiminn með eigin augum. Snemmsumars árið 1919 hélt hann því til Kaupmannahafnar eins og svo margir landar hans höfðu gert. Næstu ár var Halldór lengst af á eirðarlausu flakki um Evrópu sem var í sárum eftir heimsstyrjöldina. En árið 1922 fann hann sér athvarf í þessum sundraða heimi hjá Benediktsmunkum í Clervaux-klaustri í Lúxemborg. Þar skírðist hann til kaþólskrar trúar árið eftir og tók sér dýrlingsnafnið Kiljan eftir írskum píslarvotti.
<p>Þótt guðsorð og nám í tungumálum og bókmenntum tæki sinn tíma hélt Halldór áfram að skrifa. Hann hafði skrifað handrit að Rauða kverinu veturinn 1921 til 1922 og ári síðar kom út smásagnasafnið, Nokkrar sögur. Í klaustrinu skrifaði hann svo sína aðra skáldsögu, mikla að vöxtum sem nefnist Undir Helgahnúk. Þetta er bernskusaga og lýsir þroskaferli drengs frá fæðingu til fermingar. Trúarlegar vangaveltur eru áberandi í verkinu og á það raunar einnig við um næstu bækur Halldórs. Árið 1925 sendir hann frá sér ritið Kaþólsk viðhorf þar sem hann svarar árásum vinar síns og skáldbróður, Þórbergs Þórðarsonar, á kaþólska trú í Bréfi til Láru sem komið hafði út árið áður. Á sama tíma og hann vann að varnarritinu um kaþólskuna skrifaði Halldór bók sem kom ekki út fyrr en um aldarfjórðungi síðar, Heiman eg fór, og var „sjálfsmynd æskumanns“, eins og hann lýsti henni sjálfur. Árið 1927 kom svo út sú bók sem telst fyrsta stórvirki Halldórs, sú bók sem margir hafa talið marka upphaf nútímans í íslenskum bókmenntum, Vefarinn mikli frá Kasmír.
<p>Vefarinn mikli kom eins og vindsveipur inn í lognmollu íslenskra bókmennta á þriðja áratugnum. Það varð uppi fótur og fit og ein frægustu orð íslenskra bókmenntaskrifa féllu: „Loksins, loksins tilkomumikið skáldverk, sem rís eins og hamraborg upp úr flatneskju íslenskrar ljóða- og sagnagerðar síðustu ára! Ísland hefur eignast nýtt stórskáld ­ og það er blátt áfram skylda vor að viðurkenna það með fögnuði.“ Það var Kristján Albertsson sem taldi rétt að hringja þannig inn nýja tíma í íslenskum bókmenntum við útkomu þessarar „ógurlegu bókar“, eins og Jóhannes S. Kjarval kallaði Vefarann mikla í ritdómi.
<p>Vefarinn mikli er að mörgu leyti ófullkomið verk, byggingin er sundurlaus og persónusköpun ómarkviss. Engu að síður býr það yfir gríðarlegum áhrifamætti og það jafnvel þótt rúm sjötíu ár séu liðin frá því það kom fyrst út árið 1927. Ástæða þessa er ekki aðeins sú að verkið vekur máls á mörgum helstu spurningum mannlegrar tilvistar á tuttugustu öld heldur einnig ­ og kannski umfram allt ­ vegna þess með hvaða hætti það er gert. Frásagnarhátturinn ber nýrri heimsmynd eftirstríðsáranna glöggt vitni; hann er sundurtættur, margbrotinn og ófyrirséður, stundum jafnvel reikandi eins og hann sé óviss um markmið sitt ­ en alltaf ertandi.
<p>Óreiða tímans er ofin inn í verkið. Í því fer Halldór á kostulegt flandur um hugmyndafræðilegt svið samtímans; trúmál eru ofarlega á baugi, átök góðs og ills, sömuleiðis sósíalismi, umræða um stöðu konunnar og kvenhatur, nútímalist og ekki síst tilvistarvandi mannsins í nýjum, grimmari og óskiljanlegri heimi. Sagan segir frá átökum ungs, gáfaðs og listhneigðs manns, Steins Elliða, við þennan heim og tilveru sína í honum. Í eirðarlausri leit sinni að fótfestu hafnar hann að endingu í faðmi kaþólskrar kirkju. Þar finnur hann tilgang lífs síns og þegar konan sem hann elskaði kemur að finna hann og endurheimta vísar hann henni á bug með þeim orðum að guð einn sé sannur: „Veslings barn! sagði hann, og svipur hans var forkláraður svo hún hafði aldrei séð neitt fegra á ævi sinni. Maðurinn er blekking. Farðu og leitaðu guðs skapara þíns því alt er blekking nema hann.“</p>

<p><em>André P. Brink „’n Droë wit seisoen”</em><br>
Daar was ’n kort beriggie oor die begrafnisreëlings in die koerant en ek was van plan om dit by te woon, maar dit het skeefgeloop. Ek moes laat die oggend inkom middestad toe vir ’n ete-afspraak met ’n besoekende skryfster en kon die begrafnis as voorwendsel gebruik om die vroumens vroegtydig af te skud: een van die roomkoek-etende dames wat oor bloed, trane en ongehude moeders skryf en ’n hoed opsit vir afsprake; met ’n leserskring van tienduisende, en daarom onmisbaar vir ons tydskrif. Gevolglik was ek klaar nie in ’n goeie luim toe ek, ’n kwartier laat, van my parkeerplek af begin aanstryk in die rigting van die Carlton-sentrum nie. Ek was afgetrokke, en eers in die omgewing van die Hooggeregshof het iets tot my deurgedring. Ek het geaarsel, en opgekyk, en gaan staan. Wat was dan aan die gang? Eers ná ’n rukkie het dit my getref: die stilte. Dit was asof die gewone middestadgedruis om my weggesak het. Oral het mense stilgestaan. Motors het nie meer gery nie. Asof die hart van die stad in ’n doodskramp opgehou klop het: asof ’n ontsaglike hand in dié borskas ingegryp en die hart in ’n dodelike greep vasgevat het. Tog wás daar geluid, en juis iets soos ’n hartklop – ’n lae gedreun, byna te laag vir die oor om op te vang, asof dit direk deur die vlees en gebeente in die liggaam geïnsinueer word. Soos ’n onderaardse rammeling, maar anders as die mynskokke wat mens daagliks in Johannesburg waarneem. Naderhand het ons beweging ook gewaar. Onder van die stasie se kant af het ’n trae wal van mense in die straat aangekom en die stilte voor hulle uitgestoot: ’n dowwe, onkeerbare falanks van swartes. Hulle het nie geskreeu nie, daar was geen rumoer nie. Maar dié in die voorste linies het met hul gebalde vuiste in die lug geloop, soos takke en dryfhoute wat uitsteek bo die oppervlak van ’n swaar aankomende vloed.
<p>Uit die strate waar ons was, het swartmense in die rigting van die aankomende massa begin beweeg, ook swyend, asof die kolk hulle ingesleep het. Ons wittes – skielik baie min van ons in die yslike ruimte tussen die ontoegeeflike beton van die geboue – het begin wegskuifel na mure en pilare. Niemand het gepraat of selfs ’n skielike beweging uitgevoer nie. Die hele aksie was vertraag soos in ’n kykweer-skoot op TV. Eers later het ek te hore gekom dat daar dié dag uitspraak gegee is in een van die baie terrorismeverhore van die afgelope maande; en die skare was van Soweto af op pad om daar te wees op die uur van die uitspraak. Hulle het nie daar aangekom nie. Terwyl ek nog daar gestaan het, het die polisiesirenes begin loei en van alle kante af het vangwaens en pantsermotors aangekom. Dié geluid het ons almal plotseling uit die ban van die situasie geruk. Net daarna het die geraas soos ’n golf oor die middestad gebreek. Maar teen daardie tyd het ek al padgegee. Nou het ek minstens ’n verskoning gehad om aan my skryfster te verduidelik waarom ek laat was. Ek het nog steeds die begrafnis as voorwendsel gebruik om teen twee-uur van haar afskeid te neem. Maar ek het nie meer lus gehad om te gaan nie; ek het net nie meer kans gesien nie. By die CNA in Commissionerstraat het ek ’n kaartjie van deelneming gekoop, dit sommer in die winkel ingevul en dit in Jeppestraat gaan pos, op pad terug na my motor. Toe teruggekom huis toe – niemand het my tog die middag op kantoor verwag nie – en byna kompulsief opnuut begin blaai deur alles waarmee Ben my opgesaal het. Tot dusver het ek nog nie ’n dankie-nota van Susan ontvang nie. Maar ek het ook nie my adres op my kaartjie aangedui nie en ek twyfel of sy weet waar ek woon. Dit maak tog nie saak nie. Eintlik is dit vir ons almal beter so.
<p>Daar was mense wat gemeen het dat Susan nie die regte soort vrou vir Ben was nie; party het selfs sterk daaroor gevoel. Maar ek stem nie saam nie. Hy het iemand nodig gehad om hom aan te dryf, om te verhoed dat hy in selftevrede goedigheid verval, om namens hom doelwitte te bepaal en die energie en ambisie aan te wakker om hulle te bereik. Was dit nie vir haar nie, sou hy stellig in die een of ander klein, onbekende plattelandse skooltjie sy loopbaan geslyt het, doodtevrede om die een geslag kinders na die ander iets van geskiedenis en aardrykskunde te leer; of anders in ’n myndorp bevrediging gevind het in die „ophef” van minderbevoorregte kinders. Nou het hy dit ten minste gebring tot by een van die stad se gerekende Afrikaanse skole. Of hy dalk gelukkiger sou gewees het in ’n ander omgewing of ander omstandighede, is ’n ope vraag. Hoe kan ek – of selfs Susan – oordeel oor die komponente van sy geluk? Maar ek dink Susan het die regte slag met hom gehad. Geweet wanneer om hom te laat begaan as hy een van sy koppige bevliegings kry; wanneer hy aanpor nodig het om iets uit te rig.
<p>Ek dink sy het dit van haar pa, wat darem van plattelandse prokureur tot LV gevorder het. Haar ma, verstaan ek, is iets van ’n sentimentele mislukking wat maar gedwee volg waar haar heer en meester lei. Natuurlik, dat hy nooit hoër geklim het in die Party nie, sou óók vir Susan iets van ’n aansporing gewees het. Tussen ’n pa met groot ambisie maar nie genoeg vermoë om regtig bo uit te kom nie, en ’n man met heelwat talent maar geen ambisie nie, het sy klaarblyklik vroeg besluit wie in haar huis die toon gaan aangee. En in my poging om, in dié stadium, my skamele persoonlike herinneringe aan Ben uit te sorteer, is dit vir my makliker om van Susan te vertel. Daar was iets – ’n spanning, ’n kragveld, ’n elektrisiteit – tussen ons die keer toe ek twee weke by hulle gekuier het. Dit was net voor ek uit die Kaap na die Noorde verhuis het, ’n jaar of twaalf ná hulle troue. Vantevore het ek haar ’n paar keer ontmoet, maar nooit genoeg van haar gesien om haar regtig te leer ken nie. Nou wil ek nie met dié „kragveld” enigiets buitenissigs te kenne gee nie.
<p>Ons was darem albei te goed opgevoed vir so iets; en ons het albei – sy dit dan seker om verskillende redes – Ben se posisie tussen ons gerespekteer. Maar dit gebeur tog soms dat mens skielik op ’n bepaalde, ontsenuende manier ’n vreemdeling „herken” – sê maar as gelyke, as maat, as bondgenoot, iets dergeliks. Dit gebeur nie rasioneel nie. Dit is intuïtief, dis ’n ngewande-reaksie. Iets soos ’n geluidlose noodkreet wat beantwoord word. So was dit met Susan destyds. Tensy dit nou weer die veelskrywer is wat op loop sit. Ek is eenvoudig nie gewoond aan dié soort bestekopname nie; fiksie kom soveel vlotter as die brute, onbehoorlike waarheid. Uit die staanspoor was sy die volmaakte gasvrou, beskerm deur ’n ondeurdringbare muur van vriendelikheid. Sy het alles in die huis self gedoen, want sy kon glo nie klaarkom met bediendes nie. End-uit het sy die keurigheid gehandhaaf: die oopgeslane lakens saans, die yshouertjie by die waterkraffie, die blommerangskikking op die skinkbord waarop sy soggens my ontbyt kamer toe gebring het. Selfs op daardie vroeë uur was sy foutloos gegrimeer; die suggestie van die sagste klamte op haar lippe, oogskadu en maskara wat die intensiewe blou van haar oë benadruk het, haar krullerige blonde hare in ’n beheerste kapsel. Die laaste paar dae voor my vertrek was sy gemakliker, tuiser. Ben het hom gewoonlik laterig, voor slaaptyd, ’n rukkie in sy studeerkamer teruggetrek. Dié was ingerig in wat klaarblyklik vroeër die bediendekamer in die agterplaas was. Dit kan wees dat hy saans nog voorbereiding vir die volgende dag moes afhandel; maar my vermoede is dat hy net ’n halfuurtjie stilte wou hê, selfgenoegsaamheid of heelheid, tussen die boeke en vertroude goed om hom, elk op sy plek. Dan het sy vir my ’n laaste koppie koffie kamer toe gebring en ’n keer of wat op die voetenent kom sit en ’n rukkie gesels. Die Vrydagaand was daar een of ander skoolfunksie aan die gang en na regte moes hulle albei soontoe gaan. Maar Susan het die middag al aangekondig dat sy nie lus voel vir „die vervelige ou affêre” nie. „Buitendien,” het sy gesê, „het ons ’n gas.” „Ek is seker hy sal nie omgee om een aand alleen te bly nie.” Ben het na my gekyk. „Dis nie asof hy ’n vreemdeling is wat getrakteer hoef te word nie.” „Ek sal met plesier bly,” het ek bevestig. „Ek sou in élk geval nie gegaan het nie,” het Susan volgehou, met ’n suggestie van ’n keiharde wil onder die effens geaffekteerde musikaliteit van haar stem. Hy het nog eers, soos gewoonlik, die kinders in die bed gesit voor hy die aand weg is: die twee fraai blonde dogtertjies, albei variasies van hul ma – Suzette, as ek reg onthou, nege; en Linda sowat vyf. Ten spyte van my versekering dat ek doodtevrede sou wees met ’n stuk brood en kaas of iets dergeliks, het Susan vir ons ete voorberei en die tafel so formeel soos gewoonlik gedek, kerse en silwer en al. Ons het baie lank aan tafel bly sit. Ek het ons glase bly opvul en ’n nuwe bottel gaan haal toe die eerste leeg was; later likeur. Een of twee keer het sy ’n hand oor haar glas gehou as ek wou skink, maar naderhand nie meer moeite gedoen nie. Ongetwyfeld het sy te veel gedrink. Een van haar skouerbandjies het oor ’n bruingebrande skouer afgesak en sy het nie moeite gedoen om hom terug te stoot nie. Soms het sy een hand se vingers deur haar hare gestryk, ’n gebaar wat algaande kenmerkend van haar geword het; en soos die aand verdiep het, het haar kapsel losser geraak. Nie deurmekaar nie, net sagter. Mens merk by so ’n geleentheid klein dingetjies op. Die sensualiteit van ’n lipstifvlek op die wit damas-servet. Die kerslig wat skitter op haar ring as sy haar linkerhand beweeg. Die welwing van haar nek.
<p>Vogtigheid op die swelsel van ’n onderlip. ’n Gesprek wat op soveel maniere by woorde verby of agter woorde om gevoer word. Ek kan nie voorgee dat ek sonder meer kan onthou waaroor ons gepraat het nie. Dis ook al sewentien jaar gelede. Maar iets van die gees en rigting van die aand wel. Dit was toe al laterig. Die wyn het ’n effense blos oor haar wange gebring.
<p>„Ek beny julle, weet jy?” het ek ligtelik en vertroulik gesê. „As ek in ’n gesin soos julle s’n beland, wonder ek partykeer of my vrygeselbestaan regtig soveel voordele inhou.” „Alle gelukkige gesinne is eenders.” ’n Klein siniese, stroewe trekkie om haar mooi mond. „Maar elke ongelukkige gesin is op sy eie manier ongelukkig.” „Wat bedoel jy?” het ek ietwat uit die veld geslaan gevra. „Dis mos wat Tolstoi gesê het.” „O. Ja, natuurlik.” „Jy klink nie baie oortuig nie.” „Dis maar net dat ek – nou ja, die soort twak wat ek skryf, bring my deesdae nie meer veel in aanraking met Tolstoi nie.” Sy het haar skouers opgetrek. Die wit bandjie het los oor haar boarm bly hang. „Wat maak dit saak?” het sy met ’n onverwagte stoot driftigheid gevra. „Jy kan skryf, of dit twak is of nie. Jy kan ontslae raak van wat met jou gebeur, jy kan op die een of ander manier vorm gee daaraan. Maar wat van my?”</p>

<p>B.M.T. Broadway line. Ekspresas sustoja. Antanas Garšva išeina į peroną. Šešios iki keturių po piet. Jis žingsniuoja apytuščiu peronu. Dvi negrės žaliom sukniom stebi išeinančius. Garšva užtraukia škotiškų marškinių ziperį. Šąla rankų ir kojų pirštai, nors rugpiūčio mėnuo New Yorke. Jis lipa laiptais aukštyn. Blizga išblizginti mokasinai. Ant dešinio mažojo piršto – auksinis žiedas, motinos dovana, senelės prisiminimas. Žiede išgraviruota: 1864 metai, sukilimo metai. Šviesiaplaukis bajoras pagarbiai suklupo prie moters kojų. Gal aš mirsiu, gerbiamoji ponia, jei žūsiu – paskutinieji mano žodžiai bus – aš jus myliu, atleiskite už drąsą, aš myliu tave…
<p>Garšva eina požeminiu koridoriumi. Į 34-tąją gatvę. Vitrinose stovi manekenai. Kodėl neįrengia panoptikumų šitokiose vitrinose? Sakysim, vaškinis Napoleonas rymo užkišęs ranką už atlapo, o šalia jo – vaškinė mergaitė iš Bronxo. Suknios kaina tik dvidešimt keturi doleriai. Tik tik tik tik. Širdis per greit plaka. Noriu, kad sušiltų rankų ir kojų pirštai. Negerai šalti prieš darbą. Mano kišenėje tabletės. Tvarkoj. Daugelis genijų sirgo. Be glad you're neurotic. Knygą parašė Louis E. Bisch, M.D., .Ph.D. Du daktarai viename. Dvigubas Louis E. Bisch tvirtina: Aleksandras Didysis, Cezaris, Napoleonas, Michelangelo, Pascalis, Pope, Poe, O. Henry, Walt Whitmanas, Moljeras, Stevensonas – neurastenikai. Sąrašas įtikinąs. Pabaigoje: dr. L.E. Bisch ir Antanas Garšva.
<p>Ir Antanas Garšva pasuka dešinėn. Vėl laiptai. Per daug laiptų, jie kartojasi. Surrealizmas žlunga? Tegul. Aš pastatysiu šventos Onos bažnyčią Washington skvere (tesiunta Napoleonas, norėjęs ją perkelti į Paryžių), ir į vidų įeis dailios vienuolės su geltonom žvakėm nekaltose rankose. Elena matė, kaip iš Vilniaus 1941 metais vienuoles vežė bolševikai. Jas vežė nuvalkiotame sunkvežimukyje, toji gatvė nelygiai išgrįsta, sunkvežimukas kratė, ir stačios vienuolės griuvinėjo, jos nebuvo sportininkės. Kampuose stovėjo sargybiniai ir šautuvų buožėmis stumdė ant jų virstančias vienuoles. Vienai jie praskėlė kaktą, ir vienuolė nenušluostė kraujo, gal ji neturėjo nosinės.
<p>Antanas Garšva, pro „Gimbels“ konfekcijono stiklines duris, išeina į gatvę. Jis prilaiko duris, kol prasmunka šlakuota mergina, krūtys aiškiai dirbtinės, šešiasdešimt septyni centai pora. Jis jos nebematys. Elena – jis jos nebematys. Elena, aš tau padovanosiu karneolio žiedą ir užmirštą tramvajaus vagoną Queens aikštėje. Elena, tu man nulipdysi bajoro galvą, ji namo karnize, Pylimo gatvėje, Vilniuje. Elena… nenorėk, kad verkčiau.
<p>Antanas Garšva eina trisdešimt ketvirtąja. Į savąjį hotelį. Štai užkandinė. 7 up, coca-cola, sendvičiai su kumpiu, sūriu; itališki su saločiais. Štai krautuvė. Stiprūs batai iš Anglijos, languotos kojinės. Elena, tau padovanosiu kojines. Tu nesi tvarkinga, tu kreivai užmauni kojines, siūlė nusisukusi, numauk jas, numauk. Aš pats užmausiu nupirktąsias. Stangriai. Elena, man patinka kartoti tavo vardą. Prancūziško valso tempe. Ele na Ele na Ele na Ele na Ele na a. Truput ėlis graudulio, truputėlis skonio, esprit. Pangloss buvo metaphysicotheologicocosmonigologijos profesorius. Akmenys reikalingi tvirtovėms statyti, skelbė jis. Keliai yra susisiekimo priemonė, skelbė vienas susisiekimo ministeris. Tavo vardas reikalingas tave prisiminti. Viskas išmintinga. Noriu vėl bučiuoti tave. Išmintingai. Tik į lūpas, tik į lūpas. Aš nubrėšiu magiškąja kreida Tristano ir Izoldos kardą ant tavo kaklo. Žemiau kaklo tavęs nebučiuosiu. Tik tik, tik tik. Dėkui Dievui, jau nebešąla rankų ir kojų pirštai. Ele na Ele na Ele na Ele na Ele na a. Štai ir mano hotelis.
<p>Antanas Garšva įeina pro duris for employees, jis mosteli ranka watchmanui stiklineje būdelėje, jis ištraukia iš juodos lentos balta kortelę. Kortelėje – pavardė, elevator operator, dienos, valandos. Cakt, išpunčiuoja laikrodis metalinėje dėžutėje. Keturios valandos ir viena minutė. Širdis tik, laikrodis cakt. Watchmenai vaikščioja naktimis, pasikabinę ant pilvų laikrodžius odinėse makštyse ir punčiuoja laiką. Hotelio užkampiuose įmontuoti plieniniai stiebeliai. Cakt – išpunčiuota. Laikrodis lyg kekšė vaikščiojanti per namus. Po dviejų valandų watchroanas gali surūkyti dgaretę, ir laikrodis ilsisi ant jo nudribusio pilvo. Mano pilies miręs saulės laikrodis miega ant smėlio – rašo lietuvis poetas.
<p>Antanas Garšva lipa laiptais žemyn į rūsį. Jis sutinka negrą, kuriam ledams gaminti mašina nutraukė dešiniąją ranką iki alkūnės. Negras klausia. „Kaip gyveni?“ Garšva atsako. „Gerai, o tu?“
Negras neatsako ir lipa į viršų. Vieną kartą jis staiga pajuto karštį, ranka nukrito ant ledo gabalo, tur būt, ranka sušildė ledą. Šis negras – fanatikas. Ledui paaukoti nuosavą ranką? Herojiškas žygis. Negrui moka dolerį ir keturiolika centų į valandą.
<p>Antanas Garšva eina rūsio koridoriais. Pasieniais išrikiuotos skardinės statinės. Šildomieji vamzdžiai išrangyti lubose. Jie pasiekiami ranka. Nėra reikalo. Pirštai šilti. Kraujo transfūziją atliko pats organizmas. Leonardo da Vinci be reikalo domėjosi anatomija. Geriau jis būty nutapęs dar vieną Paskutinę Vakarienę, ant drobės vakarienė nepelytų. Geriau aš būčiau nenuėjęs į taverną ir nekalbėjęs su simpatingu Elenos vyru.<br><br>

<p>Antanas Garšva įeina į nusirengiamąją patalpą. Jis junta pažįstamą smarvę. Pirmame ruime – išeinamoji. Tik pertvarėlėmis atidalytos sėdynės, ir, jei gretimojoje tupi kaimynas, matai jo batus ir nusmukusias kelnes. Čia pat praustuvai ir veidrodžiai. Hotelio instrukcijose pažymėta: tarnautojas privalo būti švarus ir glotniai susišukavęs. Uždrausta nepaklusni poeto garbana. Dar uždrausti geltoni batai ir rūkymas tose patalpose, kuriose sutinkami hotelio lankytojai. Aš prisimenu senelio kapeliono žodžius mums, vaikučiams. „Štai pavyzdys se. Vaikutis se, gražutis se, švarutis se, nusiprausęs se“. O, kaip mes neapkentėm pirmojo mokinio!
„Ko toks liūdnas šiandien, Tony?“, klausia keltuvininkas Joe. Jis stambus ir rausvas vaikinas. Jis sėdi ant suolo ir sklaido „Fausto“ klavirą. Jis mokosi dainuoti baritonu.
<p>„Aš turiu apleisti jau …“, sudainuoja Antanas Garšva. „Šitaip prasideda lietuviškai Valentino arija.“
„Muzikali kalba“, sako Joe.
<p>„Štai ir esu lietuvių tautos ambasadorius“, galvoja Garšva.
<p>Dešinėje – durų anga ir anapus žalios spintelės drabužiams. Antanas Garšva atrakina savąją ir atitraukia škotiškų marškinių ziperį. Jis nusirengia iš lėto. Valandėlę jis vienas. Jei nebūtų Vilniaus, Elena nepasakotų apie jį. Jei nekybotų sienoje moteris (jos rankoje smuikas lyg maldaknygė, jos plaukai palaidi ir mėlyni), aš nekalbėčiau apie ją. Ir aš neišgirsčiau legendos apie klavesiną ir nebūčiau tardomas teisėjų. Ein alltaglicher Vorgang, A hat mit B aus H ein wichtiges Geschäft abzuschliessen. .. ir taip toliau. Trikampis: žmona, meilužis, vyras. Sulietuvėjęs aktorius mostelėjo rankute ir ištarė „Buridano asile“: „Esu meilužis!“ Kas man yra šiandien? Vaizdas seka vaizdą. Gal praryti tabletę? Šiandien sekmadienis, šiandien sunki darbo diena.
Antanas Garšva nukabina keltuvininko uniformą. Mėlynas kelnes su raudona siūle ir burokinės spalvos švarką su mėlynais atlapais, „auksinėmis“ sagomis, pintais antpečiais. Švarko atlapų kampuose blizga numeriai. 87 iš kairės, 87 iš dešinės. Jei svečias nepatenkintas keltuvininku, jis gali, prisiminęs numerį, įskųsti jį starteriui. „87 kalės vaikas, 87 užkėlė mane keturiais aukštais aukščiau, 87 87 87, aš sugaišau dvi minutes šioje dėžėje, prakeiktas kalės vaikas 87!“ Smagu kolioti skaičių. Smagu operuoti skaičiais. 24035 į Sibirą. Smagu. 47 žuvo lėktuvo katastrofoje. Smagu. Parduotos 7038456 adatos. Smagu. Šiąnakt Mister X buvo laimingas 3 kartus. Smagu. Šiandien Miss Y mirė 1 kartą. Smagu. Šiuo metu esu vienas ir prarysiu vieną tabletę. Ir man bus smagiau. Antanas Garšva susiranda kelnių kišenaitėje geltoną ir pailgą celiulioido šovinėlį ir praryja jį. Jis sėda ant pamestos dėžės ir laukia. Tik tik, tik tik – mano širdis. Mano smegenyse, mano gyslose, mano svajonėje.<br><br>

<p><em>Henryk Sienkiewicz „Quo Vadis?”</em><br>
<center>Rozdział 1</center>
<p>Petroniusz obudził się zaledwie koło południa i jak zwykle, zmęczony bardzo. Poprzedniego dnia był na uczcie u Nerona, która przeciągnęła się do późna w noc. Od pewnego czasu zdrowie jego zaczęło się psuć. Sam mówił, że rankami budzi się jakby zdrętwiały i bez możności zebrania myśli. Ale poranna kąpiel i staranne wygniatanie ciała przez wprawionych do tego niewolników przyśpieszało stopniowo obieg jego 1eniwej krwi, rozbudzało go, cuciło, wracało mu siły, tak że z elaeothesium, to jest z ostatniego kąpielowego przedziału, wychodził jeszcze jakby wskrzeszony, z oczyma błyszczącymi dowcipem i wesołością, odmłodzon, pełen życia, wykwintny, tak niedościgniony, że sam Otho nie mógł się z nim porównać, i prawdziwy, jak go nazywano: arbiter elegantiarum.
<p>W łaźniach publicznych bywał rzadko: chyba że zdarzył się jakiś budzący podziw retor, o którym mówiono w mieście; lub gdy w efebiach odbywały się wyjątkowo zajmujące zapasy. Zresztą miał w swej insuli własne kąpiele, które słynny wspólnik Sewerusa, Celer, rozszerzył mu, przebudował i urządził z tak nadzwyczajnym smakiem, iż sam Nero przyznawał im wyższość nad cezariańskimi, chociaż cezariańskie były obszerniejsze i urządzone z nierównie większym przepychem.
<p>Po owej więc uczcie, na której znudziwszy się błaznowaniem Watyniusza brał wraz z Neronem, Lukanem i Senecjonem udział w diatrybie: czy kobieta ma duszę – wstawszy późno, zażywał, jak zwykle, kąpieli. Dwaj ogromni balneatorzy złożyli go właśnie na cyprysowej mensie, pokrytej śnieżnym egipskim byssem – i dłońmi, maczanymi w wonnej oliwie, poczęli nacierać jego kształtne ciało – on zaś z zamkniętymi oczyma czekał, aż ciepło laconicum i ciepło ich rąk przejdzie w niego i usunie zeń znużenie.
<p>Lecz po pewnym czasie przemówił – i otworzywszy oczy jął rozpytywać o pogodę, a następnie o gemmy, które jubiler Idomen obiecał mu przysłać na dzień dzisiejszy do obejrzenia… Pokazało się, że pogoda jest piękna, połączona z lekkim powiewem od Gór Albańskich, i że gemmy nie przyszły. Petroniusz znów przymknął oczy i wydał rozkaz, by przeniesiono go do tepidarium, gdy wtem spoza kotary wychylił się nomenclator oznajmiając, że młody Markus Winicjusz, przybyły świeżo z Azji Mniejszej, przyszedł go odwiedzić.
<p>Petroniusz kazał wpuścić gościa do tepidarium, dokąd i sam się przeniósł. Winicjusz był synem jego starszej siostry, która przed laty wyszła za Marka Winicjusza, męża konsularnego z czasów Tyberiuszowych. Młody służył obecnie pod Korbulonem przeciw Partom i po ukończonej wojnie wracał do miasta. Petroniusz miał dla niego pewną słabość, graniczącą z przywiązaniem, albowiem Markus był pięknym i atletycznym młodzieńcem, a zarazem umiał zachowywać pewną estetyczną miarę w zepsuciu, co Petroniusz cenił nad wszystko.
Pozdrowienie Petroniuszowi! – rzekł młody człowiek wchodząc sprężystym krokiem do tepidarium – niech wszyscy bogowie darzą cię pomyślnością, a zwłaszcza Asklepios i Kipryda, albowiem pod ich podwójną opieką nic złego spotkać cię nie może.
<p>—Witaj w Rzymie i niech ci odpoczynek będzie słodki po wojnie – odrzekł Petroniusz wyciągając rękę spomiędzy fałd miękkiej karbassowej tkaniny, w którą był obwinięty. – Co słychać w Armenii i czy bawiąc w Azji nie zawadziłeś o Bitynię?
<p>Petroniusz był niegdyś rządcą Bitynii i co większa, rządził nią sprężyście i sprawiedliwie. Stanowiło to dziwną sprzeczność z charakterem człowieka słynnego ze swej zniewieściałości i zamiłowania do rozkoszy – dlatego lubił wspominać te czasy, albowiem stanowiły one dowód, czym by być mógł i umiał, gdyby mu się podobało.
<p>—Zdarzyło mi się być w Heraklei – odrzekł Winicjusz. – Wysłał mnie tam Korbulo z rozkazem ściągnięcia posiłków.
<p>—Ach, Heraklea! Znałem tam jedną dziewczynę z Kolchidy, za którą oddałbym wszystkie tutejsze rozwódki, nie wyłączając Poppei. Ale to dawne dzieje. Mów raczej, co słychać od ściany partyjskiej. Nudzą mnie wprawdzie te wszystkie Wologezy, Tyrydaty, Tygranesy i cała ta barbaria, która, jak twierdzi młody Arulanus, chodzi u siebie w domu jeszcze na czworakach, a tylko wobec nas udaje ludzi. Ale teraz dużo się o nich mówi w Rzymie, choćby dlatego, że niebezpiecznie mówić o czym innym.
<p>—Ta wojna źle idzie i gdyby nie Korbulo, mogłaby się zmienić w klęskę.
<p>—Korbulo! Na Bakcha! Prawdziwy to bożek wojny, istny Mars: wielki wódz; a zarazem zapalczywy, prawy i głupi. Lubię go, choćby dlatego, że Nero go się boi.
<p>—Korbulo nie jest człowiekiem głupim.
<p>—Może masz słuszność; a zresztą wszystko to jedno. Głupota, jak powiada Pyrron, w niczym nie jest gorsza od mądrości i w niczym się od niej nie różni.
Winicjusz począł opowiadać o wojnie, lecz gdy Petroniusz przymknął powieki, młody człowiek, widząc jego znużoną i nieco wychudłą twarz, zmienił przedmiot rozmowy i jął wypytywać go z pewną troskliwością o zdrowie.
Petroniusz otworzył znów oczy.
<p>Zdrowie!… Nie. On nie czuł się zdrów. Nie doszedł jeszcze wprawdzie do tego, do czego doszedł młody Sisenna, który stracił do tego stopnia czucie, że gdy go przynoszono rano do łaźni, pytał: „Czy ja siedzę?” Ale nie był zdrów. Winicjusz oddał go oto pod opiekę Asklepiosa i Kiprydy. Ale on, Petroniusz, nie wierzy w Asklepiosa. Nie wiadomo nawet, czyim był synem ten Asklepios, czy Arsinoe, czy Koronidy, a gdy matka niepewna, cóż dopiero mówić o ojcu. Kto teraz może ręczyć nawet za swego własnego ojca!
<p>Tu Petroniusz począł się śmiać, po czym mówił dalej – Posłałem wprawdzie dwa lata temu do Epidauru trzy tuziny żywych paszkotów i kubek złota, ale wiesz dlaczego? Oto powiedziałem sobie: pomoże – nie pomoże, ale nie zaszkodzi. Jeśli ludzie składają jeszcze na świecie ofiary bogom, to jednak myślę, że wszyscy rozumują tak jak ja. Wszyscy! Z wyjątkiem może mulników, którzy najmują się podróżnym przy Porta Capena. Prócz Asklepiosa miałem także do czynienia i z asklepiadami, gdym zeszłego roku chorował trochę na pęcherz. Odprawiali za mnie inkubację. Wiedziałem, że to oszuści, ale również mówiłem sobie: co mi to szkodzi! Świat stoi na oszustwie, a życie jest złudzeniem. Dusza jest także złudzeniem. Trzeba mieć jednak tyle rozumu, by umieć rozróżnić złudzenia rozkoszne od przykrych. W moim hypocaustum każę palić cedrowym drzewem posypywanym ambrą, bo wolę w życiu zapachy od zaduchów. Co do Kiprydy, której mnie także poleciłeś, doznałem jej opieki o tyle, że mam strzykanie w prawej nodze. Ale zresztą to dobra bogini! Przypuszczam, że i ty także poniesiesz teraz prędzej czy później białe gołębie na jej ołtarz.
<p>—Tak jest – rzekł Winicjusz. – Nie dosięgnęły mnie strzały Partów, ale trafił mnie grot Amora… najniespodzianiej, o kilka stadiów od bramy miasta.
<p>—Na białe kolana Charytek! Opowiesz mi to wolnym czasem – rzekł Petroniusz.
<p>—Właśnie przyszedłem zasięgnąć twej rady – odpowiedział Markus.
<p>Lecz w tej chwili weszli epilatorowie, którzy zajęli się Petroniuszem, Markus zaś zrzuciwszy tunikę wstąpił do wanny z letnią wodą, albowiem Petroniusz zaprosił go do kąpieli.
<p>—Ach, nie pytam nawet, czy masz wzajemność -odrzekł Petroniusz spoglądając na młode, jakby wykute z marmuru ciało Winicjusza. – Gdyby Lizypp był cię widział, zdobiłbyś teraz bramę wiodącą do Palatynu, jako posąg Herkulesa w młodzieńczym wieku.
<p>Młody człowiek uśmiechnął się z zadowoleniem i począł zanurzać się w wannie, wychlustywając przy tym obficie ciepłą wodę na mozaikę przedstawiającą Herę w chwili, gdy prosi Sen o uśpienie Zeusa. Petroniusz patrzył na niego zadowolonym okiem artysty.
<p>Lecz gdy skończył i oddał się z kolei epilatorom, wszedł lector z puszką brązową na brzuchu i zwojami papieru w puszce.
<p>—Czy chcesz posłuchać? – spytał Petroniusz.
<p>—Jeśli to twój utwór, chętnie! – odpowiedział Winicjusz – ale jeśli nie, wolę rozmawiać. Poeci łapią dziś ludzi na wszystkich rogach ulic.
<p>—A jakże. Nie przejdziesz koło żadnej bazyliki, koło termów, koło biblioteki lub księgarni, żebyś nie ujrzał poety gestykulującego jak małpa. Agryppa, gdy tu przyjechał ze Wschodu, wziął ich za opętanych. Ale to teraz takie czasy. Cezar pisuje wiersze, więc wszyscy idą w jego ślady. Nie wolno tylko pisywać wierszy lepszych od cezara i z tego powodu boję się trochę o Lukana… Ale ja pisuję prozą, którą jednak nie częstuję ani samego siebie, ani innych. To, co lector miał czytać, to są codicilli tego biednego Fabrycjusza Wejenta.
<p>—Dlaczego „biednego”?
<p>—Bo mu powiedziano, żeby zabawił się w Odysa i nie wracał do domowych pieleszy aż do nowego rozporządzenia. <p>Ta odyseja o tyle mu będzie lżejsza niż Odyseuszowi, że żona jego nie jest Penelopą. Nie potrzebuję ci zresztą mówić, że postąpiono głupio. Ale tu nikt inaczej rzeczy nie bierze, jak po wierzchu. To dość licha i nudna książka, którą zaczęto namiętnie czytać dopiero wówczas, gdy autor został wygnany. Teraz słychać na wszystkie strony: „Scandala! Scandala!”, i być może, że niektóre rzeczy Wejento wymyślał, ale ja, który znam miasto, znam naszych patres i nasze kobiety, upewniam cię, iż to wszystko bledsze niż rzeczywistość. Swoją drogą każdy szuka tam obecnie – siebie z obawą, a znajomych z przyjemnością. W księgarni Awirunusa stu skrybów przepisuje książkę za dyktandem – i powodzenie jej zapewnione.
<p>—Twoich sprawek tam nie ma?
<p>—Są, ale autor chybił, albowiem jestem zarazem i gorszy, i mniej płaski, niż mnie przedstawił. Widzisz, my tu dawno zatraciliśmy poczucie tego, co jest godziwe lub niegodziwe, i mnie samemu wydaje się, że tak naprawdę to tej różnicy nie ma, chociaż Seneka, Muzomusz i Trazea udają, że ją widzą. Mnie to wszystko jedno! Na Herkulesa, mówię, jak myślę! Ale zachowałem tę wyższość, że wiem, co jest szpetne, a co piękne, a tego na przykład nasz miedzianobrody poeta, furman, śpiewak, tancerz i histrio – nie rozumie.
<p>Żal mi jednak Fabrycjusza! To dobry towarzysz.
<p>Zgubiła go miłość własna. Każdy go podejrzewał, nikt dobrze nie wiedział, ale on sam nie mógł wytrzymać i na wszystkie strony rozgadywał pod sekretem. Czy ty słyszałeś historię Rufinusa?
<p>—Nie.
<p>—To przejdźmy do frigidarium, gdzie wychłodniemy i gdzie ci ją opowiem.
<p>Przeszli do frigidarium, na środku którego biła fontanna zabarwiona na kolor jasnoróżowy i roznosząca woń fiołków. Tam siadłszy w niszach wysłanych jedwabiem, poczęli się ochładzać. Przez chwilę panowało milczenie. Winicjusz patrzył czas jakiś w zamyśleniu na brązowego fauna, który przegiąwszy sobie przez ramię nimfę szukał chciwie ustami jej ust, po czym rzekł:
<p>—Ten ma słuszność. Oto co jest w życiu najlepsze. – Mniej więcej! Ale ty prócz tego kochasz wojnę, której ja nie lubię, albowiem pod namiotami paznokcie pękają i przestają być różowe. Zresztą każdy ma swoje zamiłowania. Miedzianobrody lubi śpiew, zwłaszcza swój własny, a stary Scaurus swoją wazę koryncką, która w nocy stoi przy jego łożu i którą całuje, jeśli nie może spać. Wycałował już jej brzegi. Powiedz mi, czy ty nie pisujesz wierszy?</p>

<h1>Czech</h1>
<p><em>Václav Havel: „Moc bezmocných“</em><br>
Ⅰ<br>
Východní Evropou obchází strašidlo, kterému na Západě říkají „disidentství“.
Toto strašidlo nespadlo z nebe. Je přirozeným projevem a nevyhnutelným důsledkem současné historické fáze systému, jímž obchází. Zrodila ho totiž situace, kdy tento systém už dávno není a z ti­sícerých důvodů už nemůže být založen na čisté a brutální mocenské svévoli, vylučující jakýkoliv nekonformní projev, kdy je ale na druhé straně už do té míry politicky statický, že téměř znemožňuje, aby se takový projev natrvalo uplatňoval v prostředí jeho oficiálních struktur.
<p>Kdo vlastně tito takzvaní „disidenti“ jsou? Z čeho jejich postoj vyrůstá a jaký má smysl? V čem je smysl oněch „nezávislých iniciativ“, v nichž se „disi­denti“ spojují, a jaké mají tyto iniciativy reálné šan­ce? Je na místě užívat v souvislosti s jejich působením pojmu „opozice“? Pokud ano, čím taková „opo­zice“ – v rámci tohoto systému – vlastně je, jak působí, jakou roli ve společnosti sehrává, v co doufá a v co může doufat? Je vůbec v silách a možnostech „disidentů“ – jako lidí, kteří jsou vně všech mocen­ských struktur a v postavení jakýchsi „podobčanů“ – nějak na společnost a společenský systém působit? Mohou vůbec něco změnit?
<p>Myslím, že úvaha o těchto otázkách – jako úvaha o možnostech „bezmocných“ – nemůže dost dobře začít jinak než úvahou o povaze moci v poměrech, kde tito „bezmocní“ působí.<br><br>
Ⅱ<br>
Náš systém bývá nejčastěji charakterizován jako dik­tatura, totiž diktatura politické byrokracie nad nive­lizovanou společností.
<p>Obávám se, že už samo toto označení – byť jinak jakkoli pochopitelné – skutečnou povahu moci v tomto systému spíš zatemňuje než osvětluje.
<p>Co se nám totiž pod tímto pojmem vybavuje?
<p>Řekl bych, že je v našem povědomí tradičně spo­jen s představou určité poměrně malé skupiny osob, která se v nějaké zemi násilím zmocní vlády nad většinou společnosti; která opírá svou moc odkrytě o přímé mocenské nástroje, jimiž disponuje; a kte­rou lze poměrně snadno sociálně oddělit od ovláda­né většiny. K této „tradiční“ či „klasické“ představě diktatury jaksi bytostně patří předpoklad její dočasnosti, historické efemérnosti a nezakotvenosti; její existence se nám zdá být těsně svázána s životem osob, které ji nastolily; bývá to záležitost spíš lokál­ního rozsahu a významu, a ať už se taková diktatura legitimuje tou či onou ideologií, svou moc přeci jen odvozuje především od počtu a výzbroje svých vojáků a policistů. Jako své hlavní nebezpečí přitom chápe možnost, že se objeví někdo, kdo bude po této stránce vybaven lépe a kdo vládnoucí skupinu svrhne.
<p>Myslím, že už docela vnějškový pohled musí na­povídat, že systém, v němž žijeme, má s takovouto „klasickou“ diktaturou pramálo společného:
<p>1) Není lokálně omezený, ale panuje naopak v ce­lém ohromném mocenském bloku, ovládaném jed­nou ze dvou současných supervelmocí. A i když má přirozeně své rozmanité dobové a místní zvláštnos­ti, jejich rozsah je zásadně ohraničen rámcem toho, co ho na celé ploše mocenského bloku spojuje: ne­jenže je všude na týchž principech a týmž způsobem strukturován (tj. způsobem vyvinutým vlád­noucí supervelmocí), ale navíc je ve všech zemích skrz naskrz prorostlý sítí manipulačních nástrojů velmocenského centra a totálně podřízen jeho zájmům. Tato okolnost – v „patovém“ světě nukleární rovnováhy supervelmocí – mu dává ovšem ve srov­nání s „klasickými“ diktaturami nebývalou vnější stabilitu: mnohé lokální krize, které by v izolova­ném státě vedly ke změně systému, mohou zde být řešeny mocenskými zásahy zbývající části bloku.
<p>2) Jestli ke „klasickým“ diktaturám patří jejich historická nezakotvenost – mnohdy se jeví jen ja­ko jakési výstřelky dějin, nahodilé výsledky naho­dilých sociálních procesů či lidských a davových sklonů –, pak o našem systému něco takového zda­leka tvrdit nelze: i když se všem původním společenským hnutím, z jejichž sociálního a myšlenko­vého zázemí vyrůstal, už dávno celým svým vývojem odcizil, přesto autenticita těchto hnutí (myslím tím dělnická a socialistická hnutí 19. století) mu dá­vá nepopiratelné historické zakotvení; je to určitá pevná půda, o niž se mohl opírat, než ho jeho vývoj postupně konstituoval v onu zcela novou sociální a politickou realitu, kterou dnes je a jako která už pevně vrostl do struktury světa a moderní doby. K to­muto historickému zakotvení patřilo i dobré pocho­pení sociálních rozporů doby, z něhož původní hnu­tí vycházelo; že už v samém jádře tohoto „dobrého pochopení“ byla geneticky přítomna dispozice k tomu obludnému zcizení, jež přinesl další vývoj, není přitom podstatné; ostatně i tento prvek organicky vyrůstal z dobového klimatu, a i on měl tedy cosi jako své „zakotvení“.
<p>3) Jakýmsi dědictvím onoho původního „dobré­ho pochopení“ je další zvláštnost, kterou se náš sys­tém liší od různých jiných moderních diktatur: dis­ponuje nepoměrně konciznější, logicky strukturo­vanou, obecně srozumitelnou a ze své podstaty velice pružnou ideologií, která při své komplexnosti a uzavřenosti nabývá až povahy jakéhosi sekulari­zovaného náboženství: nabízí člověku hotovou odpověď na jakoukoli otázku, nelze ji dost dobře přijmout jen částečně a její přijetí zasahuje hluboko do lidské existence. V epoše krize metafyzických a exis­tenciálních jistot, v epoše lidského vykořenění, od­cizení a ztráty smyslu světa, musí mít nutně tato ideologie zvláštní hypnotickou přitažlivost: bloudí­címu člověku nabízí snadno dostupný „domov“: stačí ji přijmout, a rázem je vše opět jasné, život dostá­vá smysl a z jeho horizontu mizí tajemství, otázky, neklid a osamělost. Za tento levný „domov“ platí ovšem člověk draho: abdikací na vlastní rozum, svědomí a odpovědnost: vždyť integrální součástí převzaté ideologie je delegování rozumu a svědomí do rukou nadřízených, totiž princip identifikace centra moci s centrem pravdy (v našem případě jde o bezprostřední navázání na byzantský césaropapismus, v němž nejvyšší instance světská je i nejvyšší in­stancí duchovní). Je pravda, že navzdory tomu vše­mu tato ideologie – aspoň na ploše našeho bloku – příliš velký vliv na člověka už nemá (snad mimo Rusko, kde stále ještě asi převládá nevolnické vědomí s jeho slepě osudovou úctou k vrchnosti a auto­matickou identifikací se vším, co vrchnost tvrdí, kombinované s velmocenským patriotismem, pro nějž jsou zájmy říše tradičně vyšší než zájmy člověka). To však není důležité, protože tu úlohu, kterou ideologie v našem systému má (bude o ní řeč), plní právě tato ideologie – právě proto, že je taková, jaká je – neobyčejně dobře.
<p>4) K tradiční představě diktatury patří – pokud jde o samu techniku moci – nutně prvek určité im­provizace; mocenské mechanismy nejsou většinou příliš fixovány; je tu hodně prostoru pro náhodnou a neregulovanou svévoli; objevují se tu ještě sociálně-mentální i faktické podmínky pro některé formy mocenského odporu; je tu zkrátka hodně povrch­ních švů, které mohou praskat dřív, než se celá mo­censká struktura stačí stabilizovat. Šedesátiletý vý­voj našeho systému v SSSR a jeho zhruba třicetiletý vývoj ve východoevropských zemích (opírající se navíc o některé dávno hotové strukturální modely ruského samoděržaví) vytvořil naopak – pokud jde o „fyzickou“ stránku moci – tak dokonalé a propra­cované mechanismy přímé i nepřímé manipulace celé společnosti, že jako „fyzický“ základ moci představují dnes už radikálně novou kvalitu. Jejich účinnost je přitom – nezapomínejme – ještě významně zesilována státním vlastnictvím a centrálně direk­tivním řízením všech výrobních prostředků, což dá­vá mocenské struktuře nebývalé a nekontrolovatel­né možnosti investovat do sebe samé (například v oblasti byrokracie a policie) a usnadňuje jí – jako jedinému zaměstnavateli – existenční manipulaci všech občanů.
<p>5) Jestli pro „klasickou“ diktaturu bývá charak­teristická atmosféra revolučního vzrušení, herois­mu, obětavosti a nadšeného násilí na všech stra­nách, pak poslední zbytky takovéto atmosféry ze života v sovětském bloku vyprchaly. Tento blok to­tiž už dávno netvoří nějakou enklávu, izolovanou od ostatního civilizačně vyspělého světa a imunní k procesům, jimiž prochází; je naopak jeho integ­rální součástí, která sdílí i spolutvoří jeho globální osud. Konkrétně to znamená, že se v naší společnosti nevyhnutelně prosazuje (a dlouhodobá koexis­tence se západním světem tento vývoj jen urychlu­je) v podstatě tatáž hierarchie životních hodnot ja­ko ve vyspělých západních zemích, čili že tu jde de facto jen o jinou podobu konzumní a industriální společnosti se všemi sociálními a duchovními důsledky, které to přináší. Bez zřetele k této dimenzi nelze dobře porozumět ani povaze moci v našem systému.
<p>Hluboká odlišnost našeho systému – co do pova­hy moci – od toho, co si tradičně představujeme pod pojmem diktatura, odlišnost patrná, jak doufám, i z tohoto zcela vnějškového srovnání, mne provo­kuje k tomu, abych pro něj zvolil – čistě pro potřebu těchto úvah – nějaké zvláštní označení. Budu-li ho dále nazývat systémem post-totalitním, pak ovšem s plným vědomím, že nejde asi o pojem nejvýstižnější; lepší mne však nenapadá. Oním „post-“ přitom nechci říci, že by šlo o systém, který už totalitní není; chci naopak říci, že je totalitní zásadně jinak, než jak jsou totalitní „klasické“ diktatury, s nimiž je v našem povědomí pojem totality obvykle spjat.
<p>Okolnosti, o nichž jsem hovořil, tvoří ovšem jen okruh podmiňujících faktorů a jakýsi jevový rámec vlastní mocenské konstituce post-totalitního systé­mu. Pokusím se nyní ukázat na některé stránky této konstituce.</p>

<p><em>Jozef Miloslav Hurban „Od Silvestra do Troch kráľov“</em><br>
Kto nezná pána Šúplatu? A jeho šmatlavú ženičku kto nevidel na rínku v Bruchoslaviciach?
<p>Hop, ale hop! Čože sú to za otázky v zábavníku Nitre?
<p>Tak je, páni moji a panie moje, prosím za odpustenie. Ja som veru myslel, že som v bruchoslavickom kasíne, a medzitým to nie je tak, lebo stojím teraz pred veľacteným slovenským obecenstvom, najmä tým, ktoré číta Nitru.
<p>Musím teda ab ovo začínať, aby aj moje láskavé obecenstvo vedelo tak, ako každý bruchoslavický obyvateľ – či je ženského, či chlapského pohlavia – vie, ako sa pán Šúplata oženil a ako sa to stalo, že si priam na Tri krále tohto roku pojal za svoju vernú a úprimnú manželku terajšiu teda pani Šúplatovú.
<p>Náš nastávajúci dej pripadá na koniec minulého a počiatok prítomného – nie storočia, ale roku. A zato táto prvá slovenská noveletka je dačo najčerstvejšie v našej literatúre tohto nielen roku, lež aj – očúvajte – tohto storočia! A preto ja viem, čo už čakať môžem od láskavého čitateľstva: samú úctu, samú poklonu, samé uznanie, samú chválu, lebo ja samý prvý podávam slovenskú noveletku na ukážku a na pochválenie.
<p>To očakávam, vopred sa osvedčujúc, že už raz bez chvály spisovateľom byť nemôžem, ale najmä spisovateľom takým zaslúžilým, spisovateľom prvej slovenskej noveletky.
<p>Náš dej sa začína na Silvestra a skončí sa na Tri krále. Naša noveletka bude teda: Od Silvestra do Troch kráľov.
<p>Ecce – aká to novitas! A ešte keď pomyslíme, že je to čas, čo len priam teraz odišiel, zadivíme sa, ako Nitra k takejto novinke prísť mohla. A to všetko nielen nám, ale aj pánu redaktorovi na nemalú česť slúžiť musí. Nech pritom mlčím o najväčšej výhre láskavého čitaťeľstva, ktoré sa tak zabaví pri prvej slovenskej noveletke ako pri nijakej inej.
<p>Ale, aby nám dakto nepovedal, že sa len sami chválime, bár sme ináč presvedčení, že dobré sa samo chváli, pristúpime už radšej len k samej historke.
<p>Na Silvestra večer sedel vo svojej chyži pán Šúplata Ďorď, aspoň sa on takto podpisúval, keď komu maličké napomenutie ohľadne zloženia interesu alebo kapitálu posielal. Bol to, ako už teraz každý šípiť môže, slovenský kapitalista.
<p>Toto bude náš hrdina, takže sme mohli bezpečne aj po jeho mene našu noveletku pomenovať a ani kritici zo Včely by nám to neboli mohli nadhadzovať ako zlé; ale máme pätnásť príčin, pre ktoré sme túto prvú slovenskú noveletku len tak pomenovali, ako stojí už na jej čele napísané.
<p>Teda nášho Šúplatu znali celé Bruchoslavice ako bohatého kapitalistu, všetky bruchoslavické panny ho mali vo svojich lajstroch ako mládenca zapísaného, klebety kmotier ho každú jeseň a každý fašiang ženili a páni Bruchoslavičania, čo dolu Váhom išli, znali ho tiež dobre a vyhýbali mu na ulici jeden pred druhým.
Mal on všetkého dosť, len jedného sa mu nedostávalo, len jedno nešťastie ho naháňalo, a to bolo – neborák Šúplata nemohol sa oženiť!
<p>—Hí, – zhíklo razom sto navydaj súcich panien.
<p>—Hí, to je zázrak – pokračujú v začatej piesni udivené Klebietkoviech tetky.
<p>Ale ináč je nie, náš Šúplata, hoc priam bol bohatý ako rarášok, predsa sa nemohol oženiť a i teraz, na Silvestra večer, nachádzame ho v rozpakoch lásky a ženby.
<p>Bol on zavčerom už ako na isté u Kačenky Kriklákoviech, ale že tatko nechce Kačenke viacej ako päťtisíc vyčítať, odišiel náš hrdina nahnevaný a teraz sa priam pristrojil a vystrojil k druhej, lebo čože je jemu nájsť si frajerku? Tisíce má dom má, všetko má – milý pán boh vie, čo je to, že sa len oženiť nemôže!
Oholil sa teda na Silvestra tak hladučko, že hoc priam ten ostrý čas dosť bol sporý v oraní jeho okrúhlej tváričky, predsa tak ulízane vyzeral, ako čo by ešte len k štvrtému krížiku sa poberal, bár kto ho dobre znal, vedel, že dnes o polnoci vhabe do piateho. Doťahoval on teda priam päťdesiateho roku svojho života.
V tomto teda okamihu, v ktorom mu čas toho päťdesiateho Silvestra na chrbát vytína, rozmýšľa usilovne o tom, ako by už predsa raz mohol zlomiť tie reťaze mládeneckej slobody. Lebo to povedať musíme, že sa bol pánu Šúplatovi tento stav slobodný už celkovito spríkril a znechutil. Tak to obyčajne býva pri tých starých mládencoch, že sa im aj to, po čom prv pachtili, naposledy zneľúbi.
<p>Pán Šúplata sedel pred zrkadlom, a my, aby sme sami nemuseli opisovať nášho Ďorďa, postavíme len to zrkadlo pred láskavé čitateľstvo, aby ho samo vidieť mohlo. Ale zrkadlo musíme opísať.
<p>Cez prostriedok beží hrubá čiara, a to je rozpuklina skla – vari bolo veľmi silné a od sily sa puklo. Jeho rámiky a malý fioček boli z hrubého papieru, pooblepované pekným, kvietkovaným papierom. V tomto puknutom zrkadle vidieť krivý nos a nadrapené oko. Ale to sa len tak zdá, lebo Šúplata má nos ešte dosť rovný a jeho oko je tiež na svojom mieste. Vlasy sa mu na hlave trochu pobelievajú, ale čo sa ktorý len trochu väčšmi zabelie, hneď ho pán Šúplata čímsi potiera, takže keď vstal od zrkadla, jeho hlavička ani len nemyslela na šediny. Ale aké sú oči, to sa v zrkadle nedá dobre vidieť. Už neviem, či sú ozaj také akési pomútené, a či je sklo na ňom zaprášené a pomastené, keď ho Šúplata vždy prstami utieral, aby len dobre mohol všetky biele vlásky vidieť a tak každý natrieť. Zuby má pekné, čierne ako havran a komu sa také páčia, nemá nič nad ne krajšie. Postava sa celá síce v zrkadle nevidí, lebo nevážilo päť centov a neviselo na dvoch klincoch od povaly až po zem, ale nakoľko sa dá súdiť podľa hlavy, ktorá celé zrkadlo zapĺňa., nie je malá.
<p>Naveky sedieť nemohol, to sa vie, najmä keď sa kamsi strojil. Zato hybko skočil zo stolice a dal sa prechodiť po svojej chyži a sám so sebou rozprávať.
<p>—No ale ad animam ma už viacej Silvester nenájde v tomto stave! Akokoľvek, ale ak by s tou Ľudmilou Hovorkoviech tiež nič nemalo byť, pojmem si za ženu tú najchudobnejšiu meštiansku dievčinu v Bruchoslaviciach na truc všetkým tým bohatým frajlám! Ale seba predsa nedám za päťtisíc zlatých! Ebugatta! Ja mám len na hotových veksľoch stotisíc a Kriklák sa mi nehanbí päťtisíc so svojou dcérou dávať. A keby nemal, už by som ani slova nepovedal, ale takto – mohol by si za šťastie pokladať, že som sa otrel o jeho dom a len za to jedno päťtisíc odrátať!
<p>Tu zamĺkne a trie si čelo tak, akoby chcel z neho jednu tisícku vyvalchovať. Po dlhšom rozmýšľaní, prechádzaní sa sem-ta, krútení hlavy, vyvalil sa na posteľ prikrytú kobercom, z ktorej ale odrazu vstal a akoby tým hodením sa na posteľ šťastná myšlienka bola do jeho veľkej hlavy vletela, takto sa dal o nej nahlas rozmýšľať.
<p>—Hm, hm, to je pravda, že Ľudmilka sá vraj za kýmsi iným blázni. Toho sú už plné Bruchoslavice. Ale akože by aj nie! Mladé je to, pekné je to, ohmivé je to, a Šúplata Ďorď bol už vtedy do sveta súci šuhaj, keď ktosi pánbohvie kde bol! To je všetko pravda, ale, ebugatta, za stotisíc veksľov sa čosi len môže a ktosi by rád bol, keby toľko hárkov papieru na spisovateľské čarbaniny mal, ako ja tisícov mám. Nuž a naposledy, ebugatta, čože chce aj sama Ľudmila! Nechže sa probuje najesť tej svojej krásy – a inšie čože má? Keď sa Hovorková nahnevá, nuž vnučka pôjde do služby. Že je ona dedička, to je pravda, nuž ale priam zato musí tak tancovať, ako jej babka hvízda, a keď by sa mi takto stará naklonila, vnučka si veľa nepomôže.
<p>Hore sa teda, Ďorde, hore sa, len okolo starej sa zakrúť! A táto sa mi pozdáva, ebugatta, len toť nedávno sa mi pekne na ulici prihovárala! Že vraj – „Herr von Šúplata, prečo sa nepáči aj k nám dakedy? Ej, ej, už hen do Kriklákov vedia nazerať?“ A držiac ruky vo vreckách na zásterke., tak sa ku mne tvárou nakláňala, až to radosť bola! „Nech sa páči, nech nás navštívia“ – tak ešte zďaleka na mňa volala. Ani raz nepoviem, že táto osoba dačo nezmýšľa. A čo sa bohatstva týka, to viem, že ak lepšie nestojí ako ja, tak ako ja iste stojí. Role má všade tam kde ja, bola by komasácia hotová; a mimo toho má v Mlákach, pod Šibenicami, v Lašidovej, a všetko hodné fľaky lúk a nivy a v horách tiež pekný táľ. – No, ad animam, to by bolo, to bude, Ďorde hore sa!
<p>Celý naradovaný, vysmiaty, vytešený, držiac pravú ruku na brušku, ľavou rozhadzoval v povetrí a prechodil sa po chyži, chvíľami zas si svoje vymastené vlasy uhládzal, k lícam pritláčal, až naposledy pekne potíšku si aj širák na hlavu postavil, nový kaput vykefoval, čižmy ručníkom trochu pooprašoval, trstenicu so strieborným okutím vzal do ruky, až sa takto šťastne namyslený a nacifrovaný na nové vohľady vystrojil. Len chvíľa ešte a nik by ho nebol viacej doma našiel. Ale vtom ho jeho vlastná kuchárka musela zabaviť a zadržať.
<p>Bol to pekný domáci výjav zo života jedného bruchoslavického boháča a priam zato škoda by bola nevidieť ho celý celučičký.
<p>Náš Šúplata nedržal veľa na kuchyňu a ako dôsledný Bruchoslavičan nasledovne ani na kuchárku. Jeho Ilona bola kus obyčajného človiečika s tým, pravda, neobyčajným znamením, že na jednú nôžku trochu zatŕhala, pritom ale hrbatá nebola, aj zuby ešte dosť husté mala, sprostučká bola tiež, to je síce pravda, ale keď si pomyslíme, že bola zas veľmi schránlivá, verná a spravodlivá, teda aj to ta ušlo a pre pána Šúplatov tichý a pokojný dom mala aj tú krásnu cnosť, že bola už väčšmi stará ako mladá a mladá chasa nemala sa za kým vláčiť.
<p>Priam na Nový rok, teda zajtra podľa nášho vyprávania, minie sa dvadsať rokov, čo spravodlivo u Šúplatov slúži, a tak je už celkom zrastená s domom nášho Ďorďa vystrájajúceho sa do vohľadov.
<p>Teraz teda, ako chcel Šúplata na zálety ako krahulec zo svojho hniezda vyletieť, plný myšlienok, ktorými bude strieľať do srdca babky a vnučky, otvoria sa dvere dokorán a dnuka vojde jeho dvadsať rokov spravodlivá kuchárka Ilona. Vpálila dnuka tak hybko, ako čo by nikdy nebola na jednu nohu šmatlala. Ukrývajúc dákysi kúštik papieru pod zásterou, počala skoro detinskou radosťou štebotať.
<p>—No, kamže, kam takto vystrojený, mladý pánko? Neviem, či už takto do druhého Silvestra svoji budeme, oni už čosi naozaj zmýšľajú, a dobre majú. Hovorím, prvý raz teraz od dvadsať rokov, že dobre majú, lebo veru mne sa už tiež odnechcieva toho služobníckeho chleba. Prv som sa bávala tej panej, ale teraz, ako hovorím, nech len spánombohom hľadajú si dáku.
<p>Pri týchto rečiach tak zaľúbene hneď na svoju ruku, hneď na svojho pána pozerala, že sa naposledy samému pánu Šúplatovi, ktorý sa ináč k Ilone ukazoval mrzutý, zachcelo zvedieť, čo sa Ilone porobilo.
<p>—Nuž, hovorteže, Ilona, hovorte, čo vás také dobré nadišlo, že ste takej dobrej vôle? – prihováral sa Ilone Šúplata, nepokojne prekračujúc z nohy na nohu a usilovne po kuchárkinej ruke okom strieľajúc.
<p>—Ej nie tak, mladý pánko, – odpovedala Ilona, – nie tak chytro, ja mienim tajomstvo svoje…
<p>—Á – tajomstvo! Teda tajomstvo, – pretŕhal pán jej reč.
<p>—Áno, áno, tajomstvo moje chcem u seba zadržať až do istého času, ktorý nie je ďaleko. Oni nech len idú, kam sú tvárou obrátený, ako hovorím, prv som sa tých ich záletov čosi-kamsi bávala, ale teraz už tie časy pominuli a ja ich sama k frajerke vystrojím.
<p>A pozrúc na zavretú ruku, rozosmiala sa.
<p>—Hehehe, mladý pánko, nebudem ja tak dlho s touto ceduľkou chodiť a na sobáš čakať, ako oni s tými ich papierikmi za ženou chodia a sobáš hľadajú.
<p>—Nože, no, nerob daromné histórie, a povedz, čo to máš v ruke, vari si dáku šajnu našla! – a hľadel akosi závistne na ruku.
<p>—Aha, šajnu, – skočila mu do reči Ilona, – veď šajnu, hej, hej, šajnu, ale akú šajnu! Keby také šajny mali, sami by im boli radi. Len neviem, či mi túto šajnu budú môcť, mladý pánko, premeniť, už čo sú priam aký bohatý, ale premeniť ju – a vtom si čosi rozmyslí a s tajomstvom vybúši, akosi víťazoslávne pred Šúplatom rozvinujúc žreb z veľkej lutrie.
<p>Šúplata, zazrúc žreb, ani nevedel čo robiť od veľkého hnevu, hneď sa chcel smiať, hneď hrešiť, čo mu to nijako do rozumu nešlo, ako jeho kuchárka môže tak nemilobohu peniaze do lutrie vyhadzovať, čo i tak za svojho života ani len raz neurobila.
<p>—Nuž ale kieho čerta sa vám porobilo, veď ste vari len nedali päť zlatých v striebre za tento kúštik daromného papiera?
<p>Ilona počala už z krivej nôžky na rovnú prestupovať, keď tieto slová očula, pomaly aj oči vypliešťala na svojho pána a nevedela si nijako vysvediť ani tých päť zlatých v striebre, ani ten kúštik vraj daromného papiera, lebo si ona ani ináč myslieť nemohla ako tak, že v tom slova pravdy niet. Dala za papierik šesť zlatých v striebre, a to si môžeme myslieť, že by ich za daromný papierik nebola dala.
Musí byť dačo vo veci! Ilona, bár bola už trochu poľakaná, predsa ešte nevypadla celkom zo svojho humoru a začala, rozumie sa, so smiechom:
<p>—Hehehe, mladý pánko, nedala som päť, ale šesť zlatých v striebre za tento papierik; ale to si – hm, to si veru vyprosím, aby mi ho daromným papierom menovali! A dvestotisíc zlatých, ktoré zaň dnes-zajtra dostanem? —Čo – dvestotisíc zlatých? Myslia si, že neviem, čo mi banka vyplatí za túto ceduľu?
<p>—Hahaha, och, ty biedna šmatlinoha, ešte mi banky bude spomínať! Ktože ťa to takými bankovými nádejami nakŕmil? Veď ja viem, že je to lós na dvestotisíc zlatých, ale ty, hus sprostá, musíš si pomyslieť, že takýchto lósov je nekonečné množstvo, z ktorého teba veru sotva vytiahnu.
<p>—Ale veď mne ten strapatý žid Renzef s istotou povedal, že akási banka vo Viedni bude túto ceduľu vari pozajtrajšku, či kedy, ale iste dosť skoro vyplácať. A to je žid statočný! – Takto odpovedala Ilona, ale Šúplata chytro odsekol:
<p>—Renzef je taký kmín ako jeho druhý kamarát a žid ako žid! Lež tajdi mi – keď si sa dala kmínskemu židovi ošudáriť, nuž maj si teraz! – Ale toto je hrozná vec – v týchto časoch všeobecnej biedy, drahoty a nahoty tak nemilobohu – koľkože, koľko? päť a či, hľa, vari šesť zlatých v striebre vyhodiť – a to pre nič za nič! Za kúštik papierika! A abys’ ešte aj to vedela, že sa takéto papieriky len za päť zlatých v striebre predávajú, ináč ani tento papierik, čo by sa ti priam kupec naň trafil, taký blázon ako ty, nepredáš! – Ale pätnásť zlatých takto vyhodiť! Tajdi, tajdi mi, nech na to ani nemyslím!
<p>Ale Ilone svitla pri týchto rečiach myšlienka, či by takto jej pán tento žreb od nej neodkúpil, lebo už bola plná strachu, že svojich pätnásť zlatých stratí, i tak aj ináč veľmi rozžalostená nad tým, že jej tak ľahko dvestotisíc z hlavy aj z vrecka pán Šúplata vyfúkol.
<p>—Nech si kúpia, mladý pánko, teda oni tento nešťastný papier, veď vari skôr ich ako mňa vytiahnu vo Viedni, a čo aj nie, nuž oni skôr znesú tú škodu ako ja! – Takto Ilona prosila Šúplatu, ale tým urobila reči koniec, lebo Šúplata div že sa neprevrátil spiatkom, čo sa mu tak hlava zakrútila a odrazu sa chytal za vrecko, aby vytiahol kľúč a zaprel chyžu.
<p>—Nedomŕzaj ma teraz, ty hus sprostá, čo ti to ide na rozum! Hahaha, no, to by som si pomohol!
<p>A tak sfúknuc sviečku horiacu na stole, pratal sa aj so smutnou Ilonou von.
<p>Po temnom pitvore ohlasovalo sa ešte dlho „pätnásť zlatých, pätnásť zlatých“, bár sa Šúplata už dakde po bruchoslavických uliciach šúpal. Keby v pitvore nebola tma, videli by sme tam skormútenú Ilonu, videli by sme ju, ako narieka nad dvestotisícmi a stará sa o svojich pätnásť zlatých. Ale takto pri tme čože poviem o jej parsúne, keď ho sám nevidím. Necháme ju teda, neborku, so žrebom pod žľabom a pôjdeme o jednu kapitolu ďalej.</p>

<center>Telik, de nem múlik.<br>
Rendkívüli állapotok<br>
Bevezetés</center>
<p>Minthogy a fagyba dermedt dél-alföldi településeket a Tiszától majdnem a Kárpátok lábáig összekötő személyvonat a sínek mentén tanácstalanul őgyelgő vasutas zavaros magyarázatai s a peronra idegesen ki-kiszaladó állomásfőnök egyre határozottabb ígéretei ellenére sem érkezett meg („Hát, kérem, ez megint fölszívódott…” – legyintett kajánul savanyú képpel a vasutas), a mindössze két, csupán efféle, úgynevezett „különleges esetben” pályára ereszthető rozzant, fapados vagonból és egy kiöregedett, beteg 424-esből összeállított mentesítő szerelvény a rá amúgy sem vonatkozó s máskülönben is hozzávetőleges menetrendhez képest jó másfél órás késéssel indult csak el, hogy a nyugat felől hiába várt személy elmaradását meglehetős közönnyel és tétova beletörődéssel fogadó helybéliek ily módon mégiscsak célhoz érjenek a szárnyvonal még hátralévő, közel ötven kilométeres útján. Mindez már senkit sem lepett meg igazán, hiszen az uralkodó állapotok természetesen ugyanúgy éreztették hatásukat a vasúti közlekedésben, mint bármi másban: a megszokások rendje megkérdőjeleződött, a mindennapi beidegződéseket szétzilálta egy megfékezhetetlenül terebélyesedő zűrzavar, a jövő alattomos, a múlt felidézhetetlen, a hétköznapi élet működése pedig kiszámíthatatlan lett, egészen a belenyugvásig, amikor már az sem elképzelhetetlen, hogy egyetlen ajtó nem nyílik többé, és a földben a búza befelé nő, mert a bomlasztó ártalomnak csupán a tünetei voltak észlelhetők, az ok fölmérhetetlen és megfoghatatlan maradt, így aztán egyebet nem is lehetett tenni, mint szívósan rávetődni mindarra, ami még megragadható, amiként tették most is az emberek, a falu állomásán, a jogos, de többnyire korlátozott ülőhelyek reményében megrohamozván a fagytól nehezen nyíló ajtókat. A fölösleges küzdelemből (mert állva, mint nemsokára kiderült, senki nem maradt) a szokásos téli rokonlátogatása után épp hazafelé igyekvő Pflaumné is jócskán kivette a részét, s mire félretaszigálva az előtte állókat s apró termetét meghazudtoló erővel föltartóztatva az utána nyomulókat, végre sikerült a menetiránnyal szemben egy ablak melletti ülést megszereznie, jó ideig nem is tudta különválasztani felháborodását a kíméletlen tülekvés láttán attól a bosszúság és szorongás között hullámzó érzéstől, hogy első osztályra váltott jegyével itt már mit sem érve a fokhagymás kolbász, a vegyes pálinka és az olcsó dohány maró bűzében, ordibáló, böfögő, „közönséges parasztok” szinte fenyegető gyűrűjében lesz kénytelen elviselni a manapság amúgy is kockázatos utazás egyetlen húsbavágó kérdését, azt ugyanis, hogy egyáltalán hazajut-e még. Teljes elszigeteltségben élő, koruknál fogva már mozdíthatatlan nővérei sohasem bocsátották volna meg, ha évek óta rendszeres tél eleji látogatását ezúttal elmulasztja, így hát kizárólag miattuk nem mondott le erről a veszélyes vállalkozásról, holott mint mindenki, maga is tisztában volt azzal, hogy valami körülötte gyökeresen megváltozott, s hogy ebben a helyzetben az a legokosabb, ha nem teszi ki magát semmiféle kockázatnak. Okosnak lenni ugyanakkor, józanul megítélni, hogy mi várható, igazán nem volt könnyű, mert akárha a levegő örökállandó összetételében történt volna hirtelen egy alapos, ám kimutathatatlan módosulás, a maga megközelíthetetlenségében mindeddig hibátlanul működő, megnevezhetetlen elv, mely forgatja, ahogy mondani szokás, a vilá got, s aminek egyetlen nyoma éppenséggel ez a világ, mintha egyszeriben veszített volna az erejéből, s emiatt aztán a veszély bizonyosságának gyötrő tudatánál is tűrhetetlenebbnek bizonyult az a közös előérzet, hogy hamarosan bármi megtörténhet, és pontosan ez a „bármi”, a gyöngülésében mutatkozó törvény volt nyugtalanítóbb minden személyes szerencsétlenségnél, s fosztotta meg egyre inkább az embereket a hűvös mérlegelés lehetőségétől. Eligazodni az elmúlt hónapokban mind gyakoribbá s ijesztőbbé váló rendkívüli események között már nemcsak azért nem lehetett, mert a hírek, a mendemondák, a szóbeszédek és a tapasztalatok egymással sehogy sem voltak összefüggésbe hozhatók (példának okáért a november elején beállt, túlságosan korai, pengő fagy, a rejtélyes családi tragédiák, az egymást érő vonatszerencsétlenségek és a távoli fővárosból származó nyugtalanító híresztelések szaporodó gyerekbandái és emlékműgyalázásai közt nemigen lehetett ésszerű kapcsolatot találni), hanem amiatt is, mert önmagában már egyetlen efféle újság sem jelentett semmit, minthogy úgy látszott, ezek csupán előjelei, ahogy egyre többen nevezték, egy „közeledő katasztrófának”. Pflaumné arról is hallott, hogy egyesek már az állatok viselkedésében tapasztalható különös változásokról kezdenek beszélni, s még ha ez megelőlegezéseként egy későbbi állapotnak, pillanatnyilag felelőtlen riogatásnak tűnt is, annyi bizonyos volt, hogy ellentétben azokkal, akiknek ez az áttekinthetetlen zűrzavar, az ő, Pflaumné meggyőződése szerint csak kapóra jött, tisztességes ember a lábát is alig merte kitenni hazulról, hiszen ahol történetesen vonatok veszhetnek el, „csak úgy!”, ott, fűzte tovább magában, már „nem számít semmi”. Felkészült hát rá, hogy útja hazafelé korántsem lesz olyan könnyű, mint volt az első osztály 11némi védettségében idejövet, hisz ezen a „szörnyű vicinálison”, gondolta idegesen, akár a legrosszabbal is számolnia kell, így – mint aki a legszívesebben láthatatlanná válna – egyenes derékkal, kislányosan összezárt lábbal, elutasító s kissé megvető tekintettel ült a helyekért folytatott civakodás lassan csöndesedő zsivajában, s míg feszült gyanakvással az ablaküvegen tükröződő, elmosódott arcok számára oly riasztó együttesét figyelte, szorongás és sóvárgás közt hányódva hol a baljós távolságra gondolt, ami elválasztotta tőle, hol az odahagyott otthon hiányzó melegségét idézte fel: a kellemes délutánokat Mádainéval és Nuszbecknéval, a hajdani sétákat vasárnaponként a Papsor lombos fái közt, s végül odahaza a könnyű bútoroknak és puha szőnyegeknek, a gondosan ápolt virágoknak és kedves kis csecsebecséinek azt a sugárzón nyugalmas rendjét, amely, jól tudta, egy világnyi kiszámíthatatlanság szigeteként, amikor ama délutánoknak és vasárnapoknak csupán az emléke él, a magafajta békés háborítatlanságra berendezkedett magányos asszony számára az egyedüli oltalom és az egyetlen menedék. Értetlenül s némiképp irigy lenézéssel állapította meg, hogy zajongó útitársai, nyilván a környék sötét tanyáin s falvaiban tengődő megannyi durva paraszt, még ezekhez a kényszerű körülményekhez is igen gyorsan képesek alkalmazkodni: mintha nem is történt volna semmi rendkívüli, körülötte meg-megzörrentek a zsírpapírba csavart elemózsiás csomagok, dugók pukkantak, és söröskupakok hullottak az olajos padlóra, innen-onnan már „a minden szépérzéket sértő”, de véleménye szerint „az efféle emberek között olyannyira mindennapos” csámcsogást is hallani lehetett, sőt vele átellenben négyen a leghangosabbak közül már bele is kezdtek egy kártyapartiba, csak ő ült a mindenünnen fölhangzó emberi be 12széd erősödő morajában még mindig mereven, szótlanul és fejét rendületlenül az ablak felé fordítva a bundája alá terített újságpapíron, s oly elveszetten és makacs gyanakvással szorította gyomrához kapcsos retiküljét, hogy jóformán föl sem fogta, amint odakint, elöl, a mozdony, két piros lámpáját a hideg sötétbe vetve, bizonytalanul elindul a téli estében. Az elégedett morgás, amelyben, bár maga is fellélegzett, azért nem vett részt, a megkönnyebbülés okozta harsány fölengedettség azonban, hogy a hosszú várakozás és fagyoskodás után végre történik velük valami, nem tartott soká, mert a szerelvény, mintha váratlanul visszavonták volna az indításra szólító parancsot, néhány ügyetlen rándulással, alig száz méterrel a falu elcsöndesedett állomásától újból megállt; ám az erre fölcsapó elégedetlenkedő ricsaj csakhamar értetlen-bosszús röhögésbe fordult át, s amikor aztán tapasztalták, hogy ez így is marad, és be kellett lássák, hogy útjuk – föltehetően a menetrenden kívül közlekedő vonat továbbgyűrűző káosza miatt – az örökös nekilódulások és megtorpanások szomorú sorozata lesz, valamennyien derűs fásultságba zuhantak, a kényszerű beletörődésnek abba a tompa kábulatába, midőn kioltandó a félelmet egy valódi megrázkódtatástól, az események anarchiáját az ember a hozzá nem értés bosszantó bizonyságaként tünteti fel, aminek idegesítő ismétlődését aztán a gúny horzsoló erejével kikezdheti. Noha az egymást követő „bemondások” nyers szelleme („Ha én is ennyit gondúkodnék az asszonnyal otthol az ágyba…!”) természetesen megbotránkoztatta érzékeny lelkét, az előzőt folyton felülmúlni akaró otromba tréfák egyébként egyre csöndesedő záporában azért Pflaumné is oldódni kezdett kissé, s olykor egy sikerültebb megjegyzés hallatán – meg persze az erre fölharsanó röhögés ellen sem 13volt valódi oltalom – maga sem bírt egy-egy szégyenlős mosolyt egészen visszafojtani. Lopva, óvatosan már meg mert kockáztatni egy-két villámgyors pillantást, ha közvetlen szomszédaira még nem is, de a távolabb ülők felé, s most, a bamba jókedvnek eme torz hangulatában – hisz így, a combjukat csapkodó férfiakkal s a tele szájjal vihogó kortalan asszonyságokkal ha valamelyest ijesztő maradt is, távolról sem látszott már annyira veszedelmesnek a vagon közönsége, mint az elején – megpróbálta mérsékletre inteni aggodalmas képzeletét, s igyekezte meggyőzni önmagát, hogy azokkal a lappangó fenyegetésekkel, amikkel érzése szerint e csúf csőcselék rideg csapata vette körül, talán nem is kell szembenéznie, s csak baljós jelekre erős fogékonyságának és ebben a jeges idegenségben túlságos árvaságának köszönheti, ha, bár bántatlanul, ám a feszült készenléttől kimerülve fog majd hazaérni.</p>

<p><em>Anton Hansen Tammsaare «Kõrboja peremees»</em><br>
Koju jõudes asus Kõrboja perenaine vanale Madlile appi, kes küttis saunaahju ja kandis suurde katlasse ämbriga vett. Seni kui ahi tossas ja vesi katlas soenes, liikusid perenaise silmad ja käed toas ning õues. Üks oli tal selge: ühe päevaga polnud võimalik Kõrbojal midagi põhjalikku ette võtta, isegi tubades mitte. Ainult ühe toa, nurgapealse, vastu rohtaeda, selle tegi perenaine põhjalikumalt puhtaks, sest siin oli veel üsna kenasti värvi põrandalaudadel ja tapeedid seintel õige asjad. Siia tahtis ta elama asuda, sest see oli juba ammust aega nime järele tema tuba olnud ja sellepärast vähem tarvitatud. Seadis voodit, äigas aknaid, riputas neile puhtad riided ette, pani mõne lille klaasiga kummutile, pistis sinna-tänna mõne halja oksa. Läks pärast õue, võttis luua ja töötas, nii et tolmupilved keerlesid. Aitas sigadele rohtu kitkuda, seda katki raiuda, söögiks teha ja ette kanda. Pesi mingisuguseid riistu, kuhu võiks tõsta suppi ja kallata piima. Tegi ja toimetas, mis kätte juhtus, aga üht ei teinud ta mitte: ei mõelnud toidule, nagu tahaks ta täna elada ainult tööst ja tegemistest, peost ja rõõmust.
<p>Vana Mousi katsus esiteks perenaisele järele sörkida, aga peagi mõistis ta oma teo asjatust, sest perenaisel polnud täna nähtavasti mingit mõistlikku eesmärki, ta tellerdas mõtteta ühest paigast teise. Mousi istus viimaks keset õue maha ja mõõtis oma väsinud silmega perenaise samme, pärast laskis ta kõhuli ja sulus rammestunud laud, ainult aeg-ajalt neid praotades.
<p>Päike oli veel mõni hea süld üleval, kui Kõrboja heinalised koju tulid ja leidsid, et saun on kuum ning vesi katlas palav.
<p>«Täna olid inimesed nagu jumala välk,» lausus Mikk.
<p>«Jaanilaupäev, sellepärast,» arvas suviline.
<p>«Uus perenaine, uus perenaine, see on põhjus,» arvas Mikk vastu.
<p>«Saaks jaanitulele!» hüüdis Leena.
<p>«Sina läheksid ikka poolest õhtupoolikust,» vastas Liisa.
<p>«Noh, perenaine, kas saun on valmis?» küsis Mikk Madlilt, kui see toast tuli.
<p>«Pole mina enam perenaine,» vastas Madli, «olen ainult vabadik. Aga saun on valmis, kuum nii et kõrvetab, veega võtke või karva, noor perenaine ise tegi kõik.»
<p>«Toho tont!» hüüdis Mikk, «või noor perenaine ise.»
<p>Töölised pidid ennast leilitama minema, kuid tuli pisut oodata: vana Rein ise oli esimest head võtma läinud, taheti lasta tema enne välja tulla. Naispere pidi viimseks jääma, sest temal oli toa ümber jooksmist, oli koperdamist köögis ja aidas ning tagatipuks laudas, kui tuli kari kellade kõlinal ja krantsi haukumisel.
<p>Anna jättis töö ja toimetuse, kui tulid heinalised. Ta laskis need teha, kes olid Kõrbojal harjunud tegema, ja käis ise pisut ringi ning vaatas, kust äärest siin küll peale hakata, kui siin kord hakkama saab. Ta läks rohtaeda, mille onu kord suurejooneliselt rajanud ja mis nüüd niisama suurejooneliselt raisku lastud minna. Nähtavasti on siin loomadki ajuti pidutsenud, puud katki tallanud, latvu napsinud. Põõsad kaovad umbrohtu, mis lokkab kui meeletu. Nõges, ohakas, kobruleht ja takjas, putk, kastehein ning orasrohi, aianurgas tapud, mis ronivad mööda vardaid ja aeda. Juba langeb neile kaste, juba hakkavad nad uimastama õhku, juba uimastavad nad sedagi, kes siin kõnnib ja hingab.
<p>Kuski laia pihlaka all vana pihastunud pink. Kõrboja perenaine katsub tema tugevust, katsub, kas kannatab veel istuda. Kannatab, perenaist kannatab! Tudiseb, vajub teisest otsast pisut madalamale, aga jääb peatuma, peab vastu, nagu võtaks viimse jõunatukese kokku. Perenaine istub, istub esimest korda omas talus, istub, nagu istus ta siin aastate eest, paljude aastate eest.
<p>Jah, millal ta istus siin viimati? Millal ta istus samal pingil, sama pihlaka all, tundes, et ta istub Kõrbojal? Viimast korda ei tea ta, ei mäleta, aga ta mäletab üht korda ja talle näib, nagu olekski see olnud viimne kord. Siis istus ta ja oli kuri, oli vihane, oli kuri häbi pärast, millele ei saanud leida seletust või põhjust. Ta oli seekord nii hirmus vihane häbi pärast, et ta kiristas hambaid, et ta mõtles eluvõtmise peale, mõtles, et ta enam kunagi ei taha näha teda ega teisi inimesi, teisi mehi. Ta oli siis õnnelik, et ta teisel, kolmandal päeval pidi ära sõitma, ja ta polnud enam kunagi segamata rõõmus, kui pidi tulema isatallu ja nägema neid paiku ja puid, kus ta oli olnud häbi pärast nii hirmus õnnetu ja kuri. Perenaine teab, et kõik oli läinud õnnelikult, õnnelikumalt, kui tema tol korral oskas aimata, aga ometi oli tal veel tänapäev nagu kahju siin pihlaka all, kus hakkas uimastama kastene rohi, et siis oli läinud kõik nii õnnelikult, ja veel tänini polnud ta häbistajale, oma vihastajale südamepõhjas, olemuse üdis täiesti andeks annud. Suure ristipäeva hommikul, kui ta teda nägi panevat oma riideid sinna mättale, kus tema, Kõrboja perenaine, hiljuti oli istunud, ja kui ta nägi teda keset järve päikesepaistel kollakasvalgel liivapõndakul ringutavat oma keha ning kuulis teda nagu looduslikus rõõmus hõiskavat, tundis ta oma veres, oma südameerkudes sedasama kurjust ja häbivalu, mis piinas teda tol korral, kui ta virutas kättepuutuva malakaga kuhugi meeletu hoobi ja jooksis märgade riietega kõigest jõust – hingeldamiseni, rammetuseni. Ta jooksis, nii et oksad veristasid ta paljaid sääri, kriimustasid ta nägu, käristasid palmikuist harunenud juukseid, jooksis, kuni siia pingile langes lõõtsutades, märjad riided nagu valatud ümber plikaliste, nurgeliste liikmete. Kuidas ta seda veel mäletab, kuidas ta iseennast selles mäletab!
<p>Ja täna, tuleb ta täna jaanitulele või jääb ehk tulemata nagu nelipühiski? Anna ei teadnud isegi, kas ta tema tulekut tahtis või mitte.
<p>Kui Jaan oma ringreisilt tagasi tuli, laskis perenaine endale sellest aru anda, küsis, kus ta käinud, keda näinud, kes tulla lubanud ja kas pillimees kindel. Alles lõpuks ütles ta:
<p>«Ja Katku?»
<p>«Ka seal käisin muidugi. Villu ütles, et eks näe. Vanad ei tule.»
<p>«Miks?» küsis Anna, et aga küsida.
<p>«Neil olla omalgi niipalju maad, et jaanitule asemeks jätkub, ütles vana Jüri ise mulle vastuseks,» seletas Jaan.
<p>«Ega see ometi tule,» ütles vana Rein tütrele, sest ta oli teise kõrvaga Anna juttu sulasega pealt kuulanud. «Asjata oli üldse sinna minna.»
<p>«Olete riius või?» küsis tütar.
<p>«Kas sa siis ise ei mäleta enam,» vastas isa, «algusest saadik riius. Me käisime ju sinu õndsa onuga esimesel aastal seal, sina olid kaasas, tahtsime Katkut ära osta või vähemalt neid heinamaid, mis tal jõe ääres meie heinamaade vastas, et nõnda Kõrboja krunti ümmargusemaks teha. Seep see põhjus ongi. Sest ajast saadik kannab ta viha, käib alati turjas. Meie sealkäimisest on üle kümne aasta aega, aga ei ole mina sestsaadik oma jalga enam üle Katku ukseläve tõstnud ja ei ole Jüri ka Kõrbojal oma nägu näidand. Nõnda me vist suremegi.»
<p>Isa rääkides tuli Annale meelde, et nad kolmekesi tõepoolest millalgi Katkul käinud, kõrb hobune sellesama vedruvankri ees, millega tal täna vaksalis vastas oldi. Tema istus onu ja isa vahel, jalad pisut kõveras, könksus, nii et nad sõites, kui vankriratas vastu puujuurikaid peksis, hirmsasti ära väsisid, päris valutama hakkasid kohe. Seda valu mäletab Anna. Veel mäletab ta seda soont, millest nad enne Katkule jõudmist üle lokerdasid: seal kasvas palju kollaseid lilli, nõgu aina valus neist, muud ei tea ta sellest nõost midagi. Veel mäletab ta mingisugust madalat ust ja lõhna, mida ta kunagi varemalt polnud tunnud, mäletab nähtavasti Katku tubade elulõhna. Nüüd enam neid tube ei ole, sest Katkule ehitati uued hooned, tehti korstengi peale.
<p>Aga Katkul on ometi veel midagi, mida Kõrboja perenaine sellest külaskäigust saadik mäletab: see on poiss, suur poisivolakas, paljad pruunid jalad, kuub särgi peal, pelglikud silmad, mis teda, Annat, aina vahivad ja vahivad, nagu tahaksid nad rääkima hakata, nagu tahaks poiss tal käest kinni võtta ja välja viia päikesepaistele. See oli Katku Villu, Katku Jüri noorem poeg, kes käis kihelkonna- või ministeeriumikoolis, sest temast pidi saama kooliõpetaja või kirjutajahärra, ükski ei teadnud kindlasti, mis asjamees Villust õige pidi saama.
<p>Nõnda hakkas Anna tutvus Villuga, hakkas isa ja onu juuresolekul, hakkas sõna lausumata, hakkas sellega, et Anna nägi Villut kohmetuvat, nägi punastavat, et ta isegi vist kohmetas ja punastas, kui ta seisis isa ja onu vahel ning vahtis seda poisivolakat, kellest pidi saama kooliõpetaja või kirjutajahärra.
<p>«Ah nii kaua peab seda meeles,» ütles Anna isale.
<p>«Ei vana Katku Jüri unusta seda ei siin- ega sealilmas,» arvas isa.
<p>«Ega siis nüüd enam keegi ta kohta pole tahtnud,» lausus tütar.
<p>«Nüüd mitte, aga see aeg võib uuesti tulla, Jüri teab seda, kardab teine. Ütleme, et Kõrbojal oleks jälle kord niisuke hakkaja peremees, nagu Oskar oli, mis sa arvad, kas ta neelud kohe Katku järel ei käiks, vähemalt nende jõeäärsete heinamaade järele. Aga mis oleks Katku ilma nende heinamaadeta? Mitte kui midagi! Seal ei võiks ükski inimene elada, surgu või nälga. Oskar pakkus ju ka tol korral neist heinamaadest sama palju, kui kogu Katku siis maksis, pakkus lõpuks rohkemgi, pakkus lihtsalt jonni pärast ja rumalast peast, et aga neid kätte saada.»</p>

<p><em>Janko Polić Kamov „Na dnu“</em><br><br>
<em>Dio prvi</em><br>
U malenoj, ispratoj flašici poslao je Arsen nekoliko pljuvački na analizu svojemu liječniku. On je bio dobio plućni katar, izbacujući dnevno čitave tucete žutih i punih komada. Arsen ih prispodabljaše koralima i spužvama, tako bijahu izdjelani. A za boju govoraše, da je žuta kao kanarinac ili žganac. Nije on podavao osobite važnosti svemu tome i već se je bio smirio s mišlju, da je to kronični katar, koji neće ni proljetno sunce presušiti.
<p>Jer eto – proljeće je tapkalo mladim, nestašnim noškama, obavitim u sjajnim čarapama. I šuma je listala kao da iza okanca proviruju nosići ženske mladosti. I ptice se natrkivahu dječjim ćeretanjem noseći let kroz granje kao djevojče, što zavija suknju, a sve na njoj govori da je za udaju. I prve kapi znoja virkahu ko polucije sazrijevajuće mladosti. Arsen je gledao cijelu tu proljet od neba do zemlje, hvatajući se očima lijetanja oblaka, što su raskuštrani prolazili nad njim, bijeli kao nevinost i puni kao suza. A on je samo pljuckao zemlju, ne štedeći djevice, što srtaše u ogrljaj temperamentnoga sunca.
<p>Arsen se je tome smijuckao. „Govorahu: proljeće, proljeće – a proljeće je došlo i sve ostade pri starom.“ Preturio je zimu čitajući, drljajući i psujući. Liječnik mu zabrani pušiti, a Arsen, videći, da je bez pušenja svako liječenje dosadno, primi se iz prikrajka jedne cigarete, a jedna čaša vuče drugu. Onda je počeo izlaziti, najprije gegavo kao seoske ekipaže, pa sve čvršće, sve stalnije do automobila. Nosio je i štap, ali više od nervoznosti, negoli od nužde. On je dapače počeo zalaziti i u gostione i pronašao, da pijača na katar ugodno djeluje. Arsen je to sa žarom dokazivao: „Evo, prospavaš se, a izjutra se raskašlješ i sipaš kao iz rukava. A glavno je, da se nepotrebno i trulo izbaci.“ Njegovi drugovi od čaše kimahu dobrodušno glavom slušajući njegova oduševljena razlaganja, koja svršavahu: „A što je još glavnije, iza pijače dobiješ apetit, a apetit, braćo, apetit je sve!“ I dobivaše apetit – štono riječ – mladoga šteneta. To je bio veliki argumenat kod njegove majke. Majka kao majka. Njoj je prvo, da njezina djeca imadu apetit, pogotovo kad sama kuha.
<p>Uopće, Arsen je s pravim zanimanjem promatrao čitavi taj „kataralni proces“, a kako je bio neke vrsti piskarala, on je tu uhvatio mnogu prispodobu. Primjerice: „Tamo se bio nadvio gust i mastan oblak, što izgledaše kao katarska pljuvačka, tek što bijaše bijele boje.“ „A zvono zazveči ko sazreo katar.“ „I Matija se Prugovečki tako nadme, kao da se raskašljao u društvu, gdje ne smije da pljune.“ A kao što katar, tako i sve one nuzgrednosti od diareje do stitichezze. Tako je on prigodne pjesme nazivao kroničnom lijavicom, a za literaturu volio je od uobičajenog „sterilna“ upotrebljavati „stitična“.
<p>Ali jednoga dana – onako od slučaja – zapazi, da je bacio krv. Čistu krv. I prije bijaše po koja pljuvačka isprepletena rđastim kao željezo prutima, ali tome ne podavaše nikakove važnosti. Sada bijaše to mrka, čista krv. A u prsima je kuhalo, u grlu je vrelo. Progovori, i glas mu se pričini sasma drugim. Nikada ne začu takvog zvuka. Razbit, mlak ko pištanje razvodnjelog tla. Kašalj ne presta. Htio je udisati zraka, ali stade se i više gušiti kao da čitavi njegov organizam ne podnaša ni svijetla ni svježine ni zdravlja. Krv!
<p>Utihnuo se, lego i počinuo. Bijaše pod „krvavim dojmom“, što tako porazno djeluje na čovjeka. Nije se tješio, da je to iz grla, iz zuba, iz nosa, jer je odmah osjetio, da to krvari pluće, da ne podnaša hladnoga zraka i da malakše. Bio je uvjeren, da se njegova bolest evolucionirala, i odmah je pomislio na smrt. Ona mu se pričini turobna i sažali se samome sebi. O staklo se već hvatalo crno noći, u sobi bijaše hladno i ukočeno, samo je u njemu vrelo i kuhalo.
<p>I drugoga se dana otpravi k liječniku. On se nije bio prepao. Dapače, osjećajući ovo nešto novo, postane znatiželjan. A liječnik ga je pregleda o i konstatirao, da pluće nije povrijeđeno.
—To se je žilica otvorila i morate nastojati, da je i opet ne izazovete. Mir, počivanje, neuzrujavanje. Najbolje, da proležite nekoliko dana, a nada sve suzdržavajte se od kašljanja. Jedan gutljaj friške vode, a ovo (tu je propisao lijek) svaka dva sata jednu žlicu. Čuvajte se nagle promjene temperature, a po ovakim vremenima ne izlazite. Čekajte sunce…
<p>Sunce je uistinu bilo već od dva dana zastrto gomilom oblaka, što su na mahove sipali sitne kaplje kao da ih sa njih truni vjetar. „Čekati sunce!“ I on je odlučio čekati sunce. Začas mu se dapače pričini, da je našao svrhu životu. „Boriti se s njom!“ Vidio je neprijatelja i osjetio sav čar borbe. I dižući se pogleda bradato lice liječnikovo i progovori sa zanosom:
<p>—Gospodine liječniče! Ja bih želio, da mi iskreno kažete, je li to tuberkola. Poslat ću vam na analizu… Budite iskreni. Ja sam Primorac, nisam melanholik. Ako se ustanovi bolest, ja ću se tek onda primiti čvrsto liječenja. Razumite!…
<p>On je još govorio. Htio je potpunu istinu, zaći u sve tajne svojega neprijatelja, i liječnik ne podnese njegovog nasrta.
<p>—Pošljite – reče.
<p>I on pošlje, a liječnik izjavi, da je zaraza tu. Arsen se ni sada ne prepade. A s pomisli, da je zaražen, osjeti ono novo još jače. On je neprijatelja imao na dohvatu i maštajući o njemu izdaleka, činjaše mu se grozan do užasa. A sad ga je prozreo i ništa ga užasna ne zahvati. Smrt mu se pričini tako jednostavnom i običnom, te se čudom nasmijao svojim pjesmama, koje ni ne bijahu drugo, no krik vjekovanja, otpora, života. Izdaleka, gledajući u ralje proždrljive nemani – on je se prepade. Ateista imadijaše da prizna veliko ništa od svega svojega: krvi, misli i mesa. Htio je živjeti i vjerovaše da živi. I u klicanju životu zaboravi na smrt. Ponašaše se kao zaborav bluda, kao ekstaza mase. Ne bijaše dubok; bijaše širok. Plovio je površinom, plovio po sebi i rijetko, na mahove, od slučaja zaronjivao bi u sebe i odmah izmiljio na vrh. A sada mu postane jasno, da je zaražen; da ima u njemu nešto, što se ne da prosuditi iz njegovih pjesama, iz njegova smijeha i njegovih lakih razgovora. Bacil je u njemu, razorni bacil, što se baca blatom na rimu njegovu i ideju njegovu. On već nije pristupačan društvu, ne smije pljuvati na pod, ni piti ne smije iz druge čaše.
<p>Takav je bio otprilike njegov pogled, što ga je plaho bacio na sve oko sebe. I ne poništi se. On je osjetio svu snagu svoje nutrine, što ga je stala skupljati oko sebe. Jer tu bijaše poprište njegove borbe, njegovih zamišljaja, uspjeha i poraza. Ovo je bolest, što osamljuje čovjeka, odstranjuje iz društva i posvećuje sebi samome.
<p>Tek je kasnije počeo pomišljati na svršetak. Jer njegove misli ne bijahu sklad, zaokruženost i logika. One se, istina, izvijahu jedna iz druge, ali si zato ne bijahu nalik. (Sin je drukčiji od oca, a nema toga, koji bi zadero u dugu prošlost, da iznese zakon hereditacije.)
<p>Duga bijaše ta prošlost. Mrka, mutna. Kao oblak u noći s rijetkim bljeskovima. Arsen nije još počeo prebirati po njoj, jer ne bijaše dovoljno sređen ni sabran. A čuvstva bijahu nalik mislima. Ne bijahu burna. Tiha i mutna. Kao oblak. Budućnost mu se ukazivaše bez turobnosti, kratka kao proljeće. On je mislio: umrijet ću, ali ću umrijeti kao čovjek. I onako se nabacano pojave u njemu dvije misli: „Punoća života i jest kratka, jer radi se o tome: ispiti vino jednim gutljajem i osjetiti svu slast alkohola – ili na mahove, kao dobrodušni staračac i solidni želuci. A živjeti znači razumjeti svoje doba i živio ja sto godina kao fratar, bio sam svejedno mrtav od poroda.“
<p>Njegova majka bijaše kao svaka majka. Udovica od dvije godine, življaše nešto od pripomoći bratove, nešto od starijeg sina prehranjujući sa tim i Arsena. On se je nazad nekoliko mjeseci vratio kući ostavivši svoj agentski posao, a oboliv ostade tako.
<p>Njegovoj majci bijaše pravo. Kao što je ocu milije imati sina uposlena u svijetu, tako je majci milije imati ga besposlena kod kuće. On bijaše još jedini, koji potrebovaše nju, a to je bilo ono, što joj ispunjavaše nekim smislom besmisleno življenje. Jedna joj kći bijaše udata za profesora Magdića, a sve drugo pomrije tijekom tih trideset godina bračnoga života. I ona se dade u službu najmlađemu sinu hvatajući ga za sebe, zavidna ženama, knjigama i drugovima, koji ga otimahu. Njezina je zavist bila nekaka podla krepost, koja s ljubavi rađa mržnju od kleveta, ogovaranja i laži. Kad bi u noći ostao do kasna vani, ona je tad imala jednoga neprijatelja: bio je to onaj, s kime bi se Arsen zadržao ili onaj, što bi ona zamišljala, da joj ga zadržava. Ona nije ni rasuđivala ni pitala, je li to zaista taj i taj; njoj bi samo sinulo koje poznato lice i odmah bi oko njega skupila svu žuć neegoisanog altruizma.
<p>Arsen ju je osjećao i razumijevao. Ona mu je dala život; ona bijaše prošlost. Sad mu je ona smetala životu; razbijaše mu sadašnjost. Njemu je sad bila suvišna; bila mu je zapravo ništa, ali on njoj ne prestajaše biti sve. A dnevice bijahu zajedno, i tu je Arsen počeo zadirati u taj ogorčeni nesklad osjećajući njezinu ljubav, što se hvatala njegove egzistence, osjećajući suvišnost i u vječnoj trzavici da skine teret sa sebe. Cijela ta borba bijaše pritajena, tek kadikad primajući otvoreni biljeg sukoba, koji je ubijao nju i ogorčavao njega. Majka i sin – sin i majka pružahu prizore najbrutalnijih sukoba, zavisti i mržnje.
<p>Njegov brat Julije bijaše trgovac. Braća bijahu u prikrivenoj antipatiji: bijahu tuđinci po idejama i nagnućima, a osjećahu vez krvi, jednih roditelja i jednoga stola.
<p>Sestru Jelku rijetko vidjevaše i zato je prema njoj bio puniji stiskajući joj katkad bijelu, pjenušavu ruku, kao da ga baš podilazi ljepota sterilne žene, koja je družica strancu, profesoru iz povijesti i ljubomornome učenjaku s vječno nakupljenim obrvama.
<p>A Jelka bijaše lijepa, razvita, crnokosa. U hodu se svijaše kao da ni nema kostiju. U nje je bio uvijek miris haljina izmiješan mirisom kosa i meso podrhtavajući kao hladetina. Nije bila rumena. Lice bijaše bronzano kao da ga osvjetljuje tama s očiju; a usne se prćile, mrko-crveno kao grožde. Ali nada sve bijahu zamamna njezina uda, jer ona je umjela slučajno prebaciti nogu preko noge, svinuti se o koljenima ili pritegnuti suknju kao rođena kokota, koja nije ni pomislila, da time privuče muškarca.
<p>Profesor mu bijaše oduvijek nesnosan. On je rado govorio o etici, koju ne skrši ni historija. Ali još je radije veličao razumnost, koja sastoji u tome, da lumpaš cijelu noć, a da se ne opiješ. Kad je htio da razgovara učenjački, hvatao se etike, a kad je htio začiniti govor duhom, govoraše o razumnosti. U školi bijaše uvijek razumna etika, pa je u nižim razredima udarao đake nogom, da si ne ozlijedi ruke.
<p>Ujak bijaše sasma drukčiji. Po zanimanju graditelj, bijaše u razgovoru prostak, sa ženom žandar, u politici cinik, u vicevima bez duha, a u samom životu jedan ogroman vic. Zato nije ni znao, zašto se oženio, kad ne bijaše kadar ljubiti, kad nije htio djece, a žena mu bijaše po vlastitom uvjerenju teret, koji je trebalo nositi i još plaćati.
<p>Njegova žena, milostiva Gorup, kako ju je sam nazivao i zahtijevao, da je tako svaki zove, bijaše anemična i puna kao vrč budjejovičke pive, dobra i meka kao palačinka, a ljepušasta kao žena, što ljubi svoga muža, koji ju katkad ošine u vinskom zanosu i draga pred ljudima u trijeznosti.
<p>Arsen sa svim tim ljudima ne zađe u razgovor dublji od objeda, cirkusa i politike. O sebi ne govoraše nikada, a o njemu su imali svi jedan pojam. Kad se ispostavila bolest, onda mu svi dotrčaše sa savjetima, jednakom zauzetošću i shvatanjem. A on je samo mahnuo glavom, primio se nekake „kućne higijene“ i shvativ, da je sve u tome: „reagirati na rastrovno djelovanje bacila sa dovoljno jakosti i spreme“ – hranio se i čas poživio uredno.</p>

<p><em>Orhan Pamuk “Cevdet Bey ve Oğulları”</em><br>
“Geceliğin kolu da, sırtım da… Bütün sınıf da… Çarşaflar da… Of, of, of, bütün yatak da sırılsıklam! Evet, her şey sırılsıklam ve ben uyandım!” diye mırıldandı Cevdet Bey. Her şey az önce gördüğü rüyadaki gibi sırılsıklamdı. Yatağında homurdanarak döndü, rüyayı hatırladı ve korktu. Rüyada, Kula’daki sübyan mektebinde hocanın karşısında oturuyordu. Başını ıslak yastıktan kaldırıp doğruldu. “Evet, hocanın karşısında oturuyorduk. Bütün okul diz boyu suya gömülmüştü,” diye söylendi. “Niye gö­ mülmüştü?” Çünkü okulun tavanı akıyordu. Tavandan akan tuzlu sular benim alnımdan ve göğsümden dökülüyor, bütün odaya yayılıyordu. Hoca da değneği ile bütün sınıfa beni gös­ teriyor, “Hep bu Cevdet’in yüzünden,” diyordu. Hocanın değ- neğiyle kendisini nasıl gösterdiğini, bütün arkadaşlarının dönüp suçlayarak ve küçümseyerek kendisine nasıl baktıklarını, kendisinden iki yaş büyük ağbisinin de herkesten çok kendisini küçümsediğini gözünün önünde canlandırınca ürperdi. Ama gözünü kırpmadan bütün sınıfı bir solukta falakadan geçiren, bir tokatla bir oğlanı bayıltan hoca, bir türlü gelip tavandan akan sular için kendisini cezalandırmıyordu. Cevdet Bey, “Herkesten başkaydım, yalnızdım, beni küçümsüyorlardı,” diye düşündü.
<p>“Ama hiçbiri gelip bana dokunmaya cesaret edemiyor, sular da bütün okulu döktürüyordu!” Korkunç rüya bir anda neşeli ve hoş bir anı oluverdi: “Ben başkaydım, yalnızdım, ama beni cezalandıramıyorlardı.” Bir kere okulun damına çıkıp, kiremitleri kırdığını hatırlayarak ayağa kalktı. “Kiremitleri kırmıştım. Kaç yaşındaydım? Yedi yaşındaydım. Şimdi otuzyediyim, nişanlandım, yakında evleneceğim.” Nişanlısını hatırlayınca heyecanlandı. “Evet, yakında evleneceğim, sonra… Aman hâlâ oyalanıyorum! Geç kaldım!” Vakti anlamak için önce pencereye koştu, perdelerin arasından dışarıya baktı. Dışarıda tuhaf bir ışık ve sis vardı. Güneşin doğduğunu anladı. Sonra bu eski alışkanlığına kızarak dönüp, saatine baktı: Alaturka yarım. “Aman, aman geç kal­ mayayım!” diye söylenerek helaya koştu.
<p>Yıkanıp temizlenince neşesi daha da arttı. Tıraş olurken gene rüyayı düşündü. Sonra Şükrü Paşa’nın konağına gideceğini hatırlayıp, o yeni ve temiz pantolonla ceketi, yakası kolalı kartonlaşmış gömleği ve zarif bulduğu kravatı taktı. Başına nişan töreninden önce kalıplattığı fesini oturttu. Küçük masa aynasında kendini seyretti ve istediği gibi olduğuna karar verdi, ama gene de içinde bir hüzün uyandı. Bütün bu şık kıyafette, nişanlısının konağına gideceği için telâşlanmasında gülünç birşeyler ol­ malıydı. Bu küçük ve zararsız hüzünle perdeleri açtı. Sis Şeh- zadebaşı Camii’nin minarelerini örtmüş, ama kubbeyi gizleye­ memişti. Yan bahçedeki çardak her zamankinden daha yeşildi. “Sıcak bir gün olacak!” diye düşündü. Çardağın altında bir kedi ağır ağır yalanıyordu. Cevdet Bey bir şey hatırlayarak pencereden uzandı ve gördü: Kupa arabası da gelmiş, evin önünde durmuştu. Atlar kuyruklarını sallıyorlar, Cevdet Bey’i bekleyen arabacı kapının önünde sigara içiyordu. Cevdet Bey hatırladığı sigara paketini ve çakmağını, cüzdanını ve bir kere daha baktığı saatini ceplerine yerleştirerek odadan çıktı.
<p>Merdivenleri her zamanki alışkanlığıyla gürültüyle indi. Gene her zamanki gibi, gürültüyü duyan Zeliha Hanım merdivenlerin eşiğinde onu gülümseyerek karşıladı ve kahvaltısının hazır olduğunu söyledi.
Cevdet Bey somurtmaya çalışarak: “Vaktim yok Zeliha Ha­ nımcığım,” dedi. “Hemen çıkıyorum!”
Yaşlı kadın üzüntüyle: “Bir şey yemeden hiç olur mu?” dedi. Cevdet Bey’in yüzündeki kararlı anlatımı görünce mutfağa koştu.
<p>Cevdet Bey kadının arkasından sıkıntıyla baktı, ama dışarı çıkamadı. Evlendikten sonra ondan nasıl kurtulacağını düşündü. Çok uzak bir akraba olan bu kadınla, burada, ana-oğul gibiydiler. Dokuz yıl önce, bu evi satın aldığında, Haseki’de ondan çok daha yakın akrabaları olmasına rağmen, hayatına daha az karışacağını düşünerek bu kadını yanına almıştı. Kimsesiz ve yoksul olan kadın ev işlerini görmek, yemekleri hazırlayıp etrafa çekidüzen vermenin karşılığında dört odalı küçük ahşap evin ilk katında kalıyordu. Cevdet Bey, kadının iyice yayılıp yerleştiği bu kata durduğu yerden bakarken, “Yanımdan ayrılmaya onu nasıl razı edeceğim?” diye düşündü. Onu evlendikten sonra yanına ala­ mazdı, çünkü tasarladığı evlilik hayatında böyle bir kadının yeri yoktu. Tasarladığı evlilik hayatı, ev işlerini gören insanlarla ilişkisinin, efendi-hizmetçi ilişkisi olması gerektiğini hissettiriyor, buradaki ana-oğul ilişkisinin bu hayata uymayacağını seziyordu. Galiba, Zeliha Hanım da bunu bildiği, Cevdet Bey’in yakında evlenip Halic’in öte yakasına taşınacağını, bu evin satılacağını öğrendiği için, son zamanlarda daha titiz ve daha gayretkeş olmuştu. Mutfaktan elinde bir tabakla çıkıp koşarak geldi.
<p>“Bir kahve yapsaydım sana, oğlum. Şimdi hemen…”
<p>“Hiç vaktim yok, hiç vaktim yok!” dedi Cevdet Bey. Tabaktaki, şu başlayan gün kadar neşeli, vişneli ekmeği gülümseyerek aldı. Kadına teşekkür ederek bir kere daha gülümsedi. Kapıdan çı­ karken, kadına sevgiyle değil, onu bırakmak zorunda kaldığı için acıyarak gülümsediğini anladı ve rahatsız oldu. Bir şey söylemiş olmak için döndü: “Akşamüzeri belki geç kahrım,” dedi, ama vicdanındaki yükü hafifletemedi.
<p>Arabaya doğru yürürken rüyasını hatırladı: “Ben başkayım, böyleyim, ama kimse beni cezalandırmıyor!” Biraz rahatladı. Ama arabacıyı görünce bir an keyfi kaçar gibi oldu. Çünkü arabacı, müşterilerinin özel hayatını iyi bilen bütün arabacılar gibi, “Ah seni gidi seni, senin bütün gün nerelere gittiğini, neler yaptığını, içinden neler geçirdiğini biliyorum!” diyen bakışlarla kendisini süzüyordu. Cevdet Bey ona da neşeyle gülümsedi, hatırım sordu. Sirkeci’ye dükkâna gideceğini söyleyip arabaya oturdu ve reçelli ekmeğini ısırdı.
<p>Araba sallanarak Vefa’nın ahşap evleri arasından hareket etti. Cevdet Bey, bü mahallede olduğundan daha da gösterişli gözüken bu kupa arabasını, nişan ve düğün törenleri sırasında gerekeceğine inandığı için üç aylığına kiralamıştı. İki ay önce, Şükrü Paşa’nın kızını kendisine vermeye razı olduğunu öğrenir öğrenmez, böyle gösterişli arahalann kiralandığı Feriköy’deki ahıra gitmiş, pazarlık etmiş, üç aylığına arabacıyla anlaşmıştı. Alacağı paşa kızının evine sıradan bir kira arabasıyla gitmek istemiyordu, ama sürücüsü ve ahır masraflarıyla iyice pahalıya oturan bir arabayı da satın almak ticari hesaplarına uymuyordu. Çok sevdiği vişne reçelli ekmeği ısırırken, “Ama bu arabayı da üç aydan fazla tutmam aptallık olur!” diye düşündü. “Çünkü kirası çok! Bu kirayı vereceğime saün alırım daha iyi… Ama satın alırsam dükkân için gereken bazı harcamaları yapamam. Ne yapmalı? Bu evlilik bana çok pahalıya oturuyor, ama şarttı…” Evliliği, yıllardır hayâlini kurduğu yeni hayatını, satın alacağı evi, kuracağı aileyi, iki kere yüzünü gördüğü nişanlısını hatırlayınca neşelendi. Bazılarının böyle gösterişli, kibar arabası tutanları küçümsediğini aklından geçirdi, ama neşeli olduğu için buna aldırış etmedi. Reçelli ekmekten bir ısırık daha aldı. “Böyle şeylere aldırış edecek olsaydım tüccar olamazdım!” diye rlüşündü “Böyle şeylerden korktukları, çekindikleri için zaten hiçbir Müslüman tüccarlığa cesaret edemiyor… Ben aldırmam! Peki hanım bir araba isterse ne olur?” Nişanlısını ve gelecekteki hayatını düşününce gene keyiflendi. İki kere gördüğü o kızdan, Nigân’dan “hanım” diye sözetmek hoşuna gitti. Yokuş aşağı inen arabayla birlikte hafif hafif sallanıyordu. “Eğer dükkân ve şirketin hesaplan buna izin verirse bir araba da satın alıveririm, canım!” diye mı­ rıldandı ve ekmeğin son lokmasını da ağzına tıkıştırdı. Sonra, yiyeceği bitince boşalan eline hüzünle bakan bir çocuk gibi, parmaklarına baktı: “Bu evlilik de elde avuçta ne varsa götürecek galiba,” diye düşünerek kederlendi.</p></div>
