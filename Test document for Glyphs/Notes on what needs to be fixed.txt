***** GS *****

GS: Have halant/virama component link to the ‘halant’ anchor, not the bottom anchor.

GS: Issue with wrong position of ra-leg in प्र, but only in the *generated* fonts. In Glyphs itself it looks fine. All the other glyphs using the ra-leg are fine – go figure…

GS: What do we do about collisions like this: उँदै हीँ et cetera…

GS: The issue of missing kerning when an indic language is set is pretty important to get fixed.


***** CES *****

CES: Reduce lenghts of black velanti.

CES: Make set of latin punctuation that match the pen & stroke of the Devanagari, and set this by an OT-feature to automatically be GSUB in when the script is set to Devanagari.

CES: uuMatra exceptions should also be made into glyphs for the conjuncts of d_uuMatra-deva, ra_uuMatra-deva, and ha_uuMatra-deva. Either that of make some special anchor for these exceptions and control it in an autofeature… (GS?)
