»Inknut Antiqua« is an Antiqua typeface for literature and long-form text. Approaching the idea of web-publishing as a modern day [private press](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_press), it is designed to evoke Venetian incunabula and humanist manuscripts, but with the quirks and idiosyncrasies of the kinds of typefaces you find in this artisanal tradition.

It comes with a complement of typographical sorts and OpenType features for the purpose. The proportions of Inknut Antiqua make it well suited for low-resolution screens.

The [Inknut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminalia_chebula) (Terminalia chebula) called »harad« in Hindi, is a nut-like fruit that can be used for ink making and is purported to cure blindness. The tree it grows from is native to the Indian sub-continent and south-east Asia.
